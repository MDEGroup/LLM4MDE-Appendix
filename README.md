Traditional plant disease classification methods are often challenging and time-consuming, making the identification of diseases a challenging task. This paper aims to bridge research gaps and address challenges in existing methodologies by proposing an efficient, effective multi-class plant disease classification approach. The research explores the application of pre-trained deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in this classification task, utilizing an open dataset comprising 52 categories of various diseases and healthy plant leaves. This study evaluated the performance of pre-trained deep CNN models, including Xception, InceptionResNetV2, InceptionV3, and ResNet50, paired with EfficientNetB3-adaptive augmented deep learning (AADL) for precise disease identification. Performance assessment was conducted using parameters such as batch size, dropout, and epoch counts, determining their accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The EfficientNetB3-AADL model outperformed the other models and conventional feature-based methods, achieving a remarkable accuracy of 98.71%. This investigation highlights the potential of the EfficientNetB3-AADL model in offering accurate, real-time disease diagnostics in agricultural systems. The findings suggest that transfer learning and augmented deep learning techniques enhance the accuracy and performance of the model. © 2013 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| No             |          | Dandelion: A scalable, cloud-based graphical language workbench for industrial low-code development                                                                                                          | There is an increasing demand nowadays for low-code development platforms (LCDPs). As they rely heavily on graphical languages rather than writing code, these platforms enable citizen developers to participate in software development. However, creating new LCDPs is very costly, since it requires building support for graphical modelling and its integration with services like model validation, recommendation systems, or code generation. While Model-driven Engineering (MDE) has developed technologies to create these components, most of them are not cloud-based, as required by LCDPs. In particular, a cloud-based graphical workbench capable of providing the scalability required by industrial applications and adequately supporting technological heterogeneity is currently missing. To fill this gap we introduce Dandelion, a cloud-based graphical language workbench for LCDPs built following an MDE approach. The tool handles model heterogeneity by using a harmonising meta-model to uniformly represent models from diverse technologies, and supports a customisable level of conformance between models and meta-models. Scalability is addressed by persisting models in a distributed, highly flexible database whose infrastructure is designed to conform to the harmonising meta-model, thus favouring model retrieval. Additionally, a customisable scalability component is introduced for lazy model loading. This paper describes the concepts and principles behind the tool design and reports on an evaluation on large synthetic process mining models, and on domain-specific languages and large industrial models used within the UGROUND company, showing promising results. © 2023 The Author(s)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

As part of this wide and diverse scenario, developers are now facing various challenges, such as heterogeneity, diversity of communication protocols, discovery of things, and coordination of services, among others. A paradigm that can help to tackle these issues is the model engineering since it allows different elements to be reused which can simplify the work of developers. In this paper, we propose SI4IoT (Service Integration for IoT), a methodology based on MDE (Model-Driven Engineering) for the development of IoT systems. This methodology enables automatic code generation, making it easier for developers to design sophisticated new IoT applications. We focus on a DSL (Domain-Specific Language), a graphic editor, and a set of M2T (Model-to-Text) transformations that generate code for software artifacts on Arduino, Node-Red, Ballerina, and NCL-Lua for deployment on hardware nodes, web services, and DTV (Digital TV). Our proposal consists of a model for the integration of services made up of three layers: physical, logical, and application. To validate our proposal, a Smart Home scenario has been considered, with sensors and actuators which, when combined, allow control of lights and heating. In addition, it allows the user to receive information about their home on television based on the REST services that have been created for the IoT nodes. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| No             |          | MSGCL: inferring miRNA–disease associations based on multi-view self-supervised graph structure contrastive learning                                                                                         | Potential miRNA–disease associations (MDA) play an important role in the discovery of complex human disease etiology. Therefore, MDA prediction is an attractive research topic in the field of biomedical machine learning. Recently, several models have been proposed for this task, but their performance limited by over-reliance on relevant network information with noisy graph structure connections. However, the application of self-supervised graph structure learning to MDA tasks remains unexplored. Our study is the first to use multi-view self-supervised contrastive learning (MSGCL) for MDA prediction. Specifically, we generated a learner view without association labels of miRNAs and diseases as input, and utilized the known association network to generate an anchor view that provides guiding signals for the learner view. The graph structure was optimized by designing a contrastive loss to maximize the consistency between the anchor and learner views. Our model is similar to a pre-trained model that continuously optimizes upstream tasks for high-quality association graph topology, thereby enhancing the latent representation of association predictions. The experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 2.79% and 3.20% in area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and area under the precision/recall curve (AUPR), respectively. © Crown copyright 2023.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Often, rules are scattered throughout the application documentation and code, making it challenging to modify them. Because business rules change more frequently, it is preferable to externalize the rules and move them outside the application. The requirements specification can serve as a valuable source for extracting and classifying rules that can further aid in assigning the rules to the appropriate teams based on their areas of expertise and externalizing the rules in the implementation. We introduce RClassify, which extracts and classifies rules from requirements specifications spread across several NL documents into eight different business rule classes. RClassify combines NLP and ML-based classification approaches to improve classification accuracy. We discuss the implementation of this approach in three real-world large-size and complex products, demonstrating its effectiveness, experience, and lessons learned.

| No             |          | Assessing the usefulness of a visual programming IDE for large-scale automation software                                                                                                                     | Industrial control applications are usually designed by domain experts instead of software engineers. These experts frequently use visual programming languages based on standards such as IEC 61131-3 and IEC 61499. The standards apply model-based engineering concepts to abstract from hardware and low-level communication. Developing industrial control software is challenging due to the fact that control systems are usually unique and need to be maintained for many years. The arising challenges, together with the growing complexity of control software, require very usable model-based development environments for visual programming languages. However, so far only little empirical research exists on the practical usefulness of such environments, i.e., their usability and utility. In this paper, we discuss common control software maintenance tasks and tool capabilities based on existing research and show the realization of these capabilities in the 4diac IDE. We performed a walkthrough of the demonstrated capabilities using the cognitive dimensions of notations framework from the field of human–computer interaction. We then improved the tool and conducted a user study involving ten industrial automation engineers, who used the 4diac IDE in a realistic control software maintenance scenario. Based on lessons learnt from this study, we adapted the 4diac IDE to better handle large graphical models. We evaluated these changes in a reassessment study with automation engineers from seven industrial enterprises. We derive general implications with respect to large-scale applications for developers of IDEs that we deem applicable in the context of (visual) model-based engineering tools. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Its objective is to identify the correct answer from a given set of options, based on the provided background passage and question. Recent advancements in large-scale Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have yielded impressive performance in MCQA. However, achieving such performance requires a significant number of training samples, leading to time-consuming and labor-intensive sample acquisition and annotation processes. To overcome the limitation posed by the availability of training samples, this paper explores the potential of leveraging the [Mask] token, which is commonly used in Masked Language Modeling (MLM) during the self-supervised training of PLMs. Specifically, the paper introduces a straightforward yet effective approach called [Mask] based Data Augmentation (MDA). The proposed method involves injecting [Mask] tokens into background passages to create masked versions of the original data. Moreover, a self-evaluator is introduced to regulate the process of masking production, with the objective of minimizing negative impact caused by argumentation noise. The effectiveness of the proposed method is empirically validated using various benchmark MCQA datasets. Experimental results demonstrate considerable improvements over state-of-the-arts. © 2023 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

However, its adoption remains limited for several reasons: The complexity of the tools makes them less productive, the modeling languages and the mechanisms manipulating the models are hard to grasp. In that sense, low-code platforms are an interesting proposition. These low-code platforms, despite their simplicity of use, do not allow the design of large systems because of the opacity of the various artifacts (models, code, generation..). In our work, we want to improve the adoption of MDE models, tools, and mechanisms in application design process through a more simplified interaction. Rather than constraining the developer in a closed environment as it is the case with the Low-code platforms, we wish to allow him to have access, if he wishes, to models as well as the generation mechanisms of the application. We propose to build applications that are instrumented with modification actions on each element of their user interface. The applications are generated from models. A developer can modify or develop his application directly from the UI by calling upon the added modification actions. This makes his work easier by quickly locating (in the UI of the produced application) where to make the modifications and directly visualizing the result, rather than manually modifying each part of the model concerned. The instrumentation is based on a descriptive language for possible modification actions and a mechanism for injecting this language into the application generation chain. We have designed a demonstrator allowing us to conduct experiments, with various audience, in order to validate our work. © 2022 ACM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| No             |          | QMaxUSE: A new tool for verifying UML class diagrams and OCL invariants                                                                                                                                      | Formal verification of a UML class diagram annotated with OCL constraints has been a long-standing challenge in Model-driven Engineering. In the past decades, many tools and techniques have been proposed to tackle this challenge. However, they do not scale well and are often unable to locate the conflicts when then number of OCL constraints significantly increases. In this paper, we present a new tool called QMaxUSE. This tool is designed for verifying UML class diagrams annotated with large number of OCL invariants. QMaxUSE is easy to install and deploy. It offers two distinct features. (1) A simple query language that allows users to choose parts of a UML class diagram to be verified. (2) A new procedure that is capable of performing concurrent verification. © 2023 The Author(s)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Complex Event Processing (CEP) is a technique that enables organizations to analyze data and identify complex and meaningful events. CEP uses patterns written in an Event Pattern Language (EPL) to describe an event. However, producing patterns and rules using EPL remains a significant challenge.This research benefits from data analysis and model-driven engineering to automatically produce CEP rules that allow domain experts to extract and define patterns automatically, even if unfamiliar with data analysis or CEP rule design. At the end of the paper, a case problem is solved, resulting in a coverage coefficient of 60%, an average accuracy of 82.5%, and an average precision of 82%. The results show that this combined approach is beneficial in providing a more appropriate response in less time. © 2023 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

One of the most widely used kinds of models—domain models—are used during requirements analysis or the early stages of design to capture the domain concepts and relationships in the form of class diagrams. Modellers perform domain modelling to transform the problem descriptions that express informal requirements in natural language to domain models, which are more concise and analyzable. However, this manual practice of domain modelling is laborious and time-consuming. Existing approaches, which aim to assist modellers by automating or semi-automating the construction of domain models from problem descriptions, fail to address three non-trivial aspects of automated domain modelling. First, automatically extracted domain models from existing approaches are not accurate enough to be used directly or with minor modifications for software development or teaching purposes. Second, existing approaches do not support modeller-system interactions beyond providing recommendations. Finally, existing approaches do not facilitate the modellers to learn the rationale behind the modelling decisions taken by an extractor system. Therefore, in this paper, we extend our previous work to facilitate bot-modeller interactions. We propose an algorithm to discover alternative configurations during bot-modeller interactions. Our bot uses this algorithm to find alternative configurations and then present these configurations in the form of suggestions to modellers. Our bot then updates the domain model in response to the acceptance of these suggestions by a modeller. Furthermore, we evaluate the bot for its effectiveness and performance for the test problem descriptions. Our bot achieves median F1 scores of 86%, 91%, and 90% in the Found Configurations, Offered Suggestions, and Updated Domain Models categories, respectively. We also show that the median time taken by our bot to find alternative configurations is 55.5ms for the problem descriptions which are similar to the test problem descriptions in terms of model size and complexity. Finally, we conduct a pilot user study to assess the benefits and limitations of our bot and present the lessons learned from our study in preparation for a large-scale user study. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

However, current approaches mainly rely on graph-based visual metaphors, which do not scale well with large model sizes. To address this issue, we introduce model sensemaking strategies: purposeful model visualisations based on alternative visual metaphors. We define them as reusable patterns that yield tailored visualisations when applied to meta-models. This paper presents a catalogue of domain-specific and domain-Agnostic sensemaking strategies, and a recommender that suggests suitable strategies for a given meta-model. To showcase the framework's applicability, we have implemented some of these strategies in Dandelion, an industrial, low-code graphical language workbench for the cloud. Using this platform, we have evaluated the effectiveness of the strategies to visualise large industrial models by the UGROUND company. © 2023 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| No             |          | A Novel Method for General Hierarchical System Modeling via Colored Petri Nets Based on Transition Extractions from Real Datasets                                                                            | The Colored Petri net (CPN) has evolved into a complete modeling language, which is based on the object-oriented paradigm. Although this language is quite complete and can be used to accurately model a wide variety of systems, it seems that there is a lack of certain modeling rules, which can be used to generate models based on real datasets. This paper is a first attempt to incorporate sequences of real system events and translate them into sequences of Petri net transitions. Then, well-defined modeling rules control the model generation based on these transitions. The specific entities that take part in each of the real system events, as well as their attributes are also considered. The models produced using real data are structured because, in the majority of real systems, each incurring event usually affects a part of the system. Then, this effect is propagated to the entire system. Therefore, it is much easier to divide the entire model into distinct parts when real data are used and then interconnect these parts to build an entire model. This is a very important aspect when modeling very large systems. To test our approach, we used the real data from a courier company to generate its model. Our simulation results have shown that we managed to obtain quite accurate results through the model produced by the actual data. © 2022 by the authors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| No             |          | A Domain-Specific Language and Model-Based Engine for Implementing IoT Dashboard Web Applications                                                                                                            | The Internet of Things (IoT) has become one of the fundamental pillars of the digital transformation of society, with favorable impacts on people’s quality of life. Furthermore, IoT systems generate large volumes of data at very high speeds, which come from diverse sources (heterogeneous sensors), requiring the permanent adaptation of the content and the way of presenting the information to the user; hence, a low-level implementation approach becomes unproductive. In this context, Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) has proven to be an appropriate software development approach to cope with the complexity and evolution of IoT systems. However, there are few proposals for Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) aimed at building dashboards that synthesize the metrics and fundamental monitoring data of an IoT system. Therefore, this paper proposes a DSL and a model-based transformation engine to design and automatically implement IoT dashboard visualization web applications that combine pages, panels, charts, grids, data filters, hyperlinks, and labels with warnings and prescriptive recommendations. In addition, the proposed solution abstracts implementation details from heterogeneous data sources (physical and virtual sensors), making them transparent to domain experts. The empirical evaluation of the solution through a quasi-experiment based on the Method Evaluation Model (MEM) showed that the participants perceived the solution as useful and easy to use, so they would be willing to use it in the future. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

To respond to this problem, many NoSQL databases have emerged, such as document-oriented, graph-oriented, key-value-oriented and columnoriented databases. These databases, which revolve around Big Data, have shown an important power in the management of big data. The scientific contribution of the work presented in this article is the application of an MDA approach on a document-oriented approach. We demonstrate the capacity and adaptability of the model-oriented approach on NoSQL approaches, in particular the document-oriented approach. For the presentation of this work we started by introducing the context of our studies which is the MDA approach and the document-oriented approach, then we defined the different metamodels of the sources and targets. We then introduced the different possible model-to-model and model-to-Text transformations using the QVTo transformation language. Finally, we presented as result the document-oriented PSM model and the XMI model generated from the Model to Text transformation with Acceleo. Our motivation for this contribution comes down to the fact that a minority of authors who integrate the concept of programming by model. © 2023 Little Lion Scientific.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Problem: Although UML provides the user with several diagrams for software modeling, the language still leaves gaps, such as a poor capacity for modeling time constraints, and simulating the desired behaviour of software. Thus, using only UML to model distributed systems developed using microservices, and also modeling time constraints and system's behaviour becomes an issue that has been identified by many researchers. Proposed solution: Seeking to mitigate UML gaps, an Electronic Document Management System (SGED) modeled using UML was transcribed to Petri nets with time, using a bottom-up approach. In addition, formal verification and analysis of the model's properties were performed. Results: Through the Petri Nets model with time, it was possible to analyze the behaviour of the modelled system, as well as analyze the systems' properties, and then detect and prevent possible unwanted behaviour. Contributions: As for conclusion, it is clear the importance of using formal methods in practice, specially Petri nets, in systems with microservices where time constraints are crucial for their correct behaviour. In addition, it is feasible to construct large models by composing Petri nets, using a bottom-up approach, which corresponds nicely with the architecture of microservices, with independent, loosely coupling services. © 2022 ACM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| No             |          | A Transferable Deep Learning Prognosis Model for Predicting Stroke Patients' Recovery in Different Rehabilitation Trainings                                                                                  | Since the underlying mechanisms of neurorehabilitation are not fully understood, the prognosis of stroke recovery faces significant difficulties. Recovery outcomes can vary when undergoing different treatments; however, few models have been developed to predict patient outcomes toward multiple treatments. In this study, we aimed to investigate the potential of predicting a treatment's outcome using a deep learning prognosis model developed for another treatment. A total of 15 stroke survivors were recruited in this study, and their clinical and physiological data were measured before and after the treatment (clinical measurement, biomechanical measurement, and electroencephalography (EEG) measurement). Multiple biomarkers and clinical scale scores of patients who had completed manual stretching rehabilitation training were analyzed. Data were used to train deep learning prognosis models, yielding an 87.50% prognosis accuracy. Pre-trained prognosis models were then applied to patients who completed robotic-assisted stretching training, yielding a prognosis accuracy of 91.84%. Interpretation of the deep learning models revealed several key factors influencing patients' recoveries, including the plantar-flexor active range of movement (r = 0.930, P = 0.02), dorsiflexor strength (r = 0.932, P = 0.002), plantar-flexor strength (r = 0.930, P = 0.002), EEG power spectrum density and EEG functional connectivities in the occipital, central parietal, and parietal areas. Our results suggest (i) that deep learning can be a promising method for accurate prediction of the recovery potential of stroke patients in clinical scenarios and (ii) that it can be successfully applied to different rehabilitation trainings with explainable factors. © 2013 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

However, traditional manual testing methods are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to human errors. To address this issue, an automated testing method is proposed for power system models. The method consists of three stages: scenario generation and simulation, simulation data processing, and test report generation. In the scenario generation and simulation stage, a large number of scenarios are generated based on different short circuit ratios, fault buses, fault types, control loops, control loop parameters, and parameter values. By utilizing the Python interface provided by PSCAD/EMTDC, the parameters of the power system model are automatically read and set, and a series of test tasks are executed, enabling fast, accurate, and reliable automated testing of power system models. To handle the generated simulation data, an automated method is proposed for fault data acquisition, dynamic curve plotting, and feature data extraction. Computer technology and data processing algorithms are leveraged to automatically analyze and evaluate the test results and generate detailed simulation test reports in this method. Additionally, the method reduces the overall runtime by adopting the fast initialization of simulation using PSCAD/EMTDC snapshot files in the scenario generation and simulation stage, which eliminates the need for system initialization, thereby improving development and execution efficiency. © 2023 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

These model zoos contain metadata describing the properties of the ML models and datasets. The metadata serves crucial roles for reporting, auditing, ensuring reproducibility, and enhancing interpretability. Despite the growing adoption of descriptive formats like datasheets and model cards, the metadata available in existing model zoos remains notably limited. Moreover, existing formats have limited expressiveness, thus constraining the potential use of model repositories, extending their purpose beyond mere storage for pre-trained models. This paper proposes a unified metadata representation format for model zoos. We illustrate that comprehensive metadata enables a diverse range of applications, encompassing model search, reuse, comparison, and composition of ML models. We also detail the design and highlight the implementation of an advanced model zoo system built on top of our proposed metadata representation. © 2013 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| No             |          | Deep Generative Models for Synthetic Data: A Survey                                                                                                                                                          | A growing interest in synthetic data has stimulated the development and advancement of a large variety of deep generative models for a wide range of applications. However, as this research has progressed, its streams have become more specialized and disconnected from one another. This is why models for synthesizing text data for natural language processing cannot readily be compared to models for synthesizing health records anymore. To mitigate this isolation, we propose a data-driven evaluation framework for generative models for synthetic sequential data, an important and challenging sub-category of synthetic data, based on five high-level criteria: representativeness, novelty, realism, diversity and coherence of a synthetic data-set relative to the original data-set regardless of the models' internal structures. The criteria reflect requirements different domains impose on synthetic data and allow model users to assess the quality of synthetic data across models. In a critical review of generative models for sequential data, we examine and compare the importance of each performance criterion in numerous domains. We find that realism and coherence are more important for synthetic data natural language, speech and audio processing tasks. At the same time, novelty and representativeness are more important for healthcare and mobility data. We also find that measurement of representativeness is often accomplished using statistical metrics, realism by using human judgement, and novelty using privacy tests. © 2013 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Nevertheless, a large quantity of knowledge is generated during the whole life cycle of complex products, and it is crucial to use this knowledge to implement iterative product design. The application of knowledge in the product design stage is mostly based on knowledge pushing from static knowledge base, which is prone to problems such as inefficient knowledge management and insufficient expression of semantic relationships, and does not combine with product iterative design scenarios. To this end, this paper proposes an iterative design knowledge pushing method combining SysML(System Modeling Language) and knowledge graphs. Firstly, the method constructs a SysML-based iterative product design system model for supporting the determination of iterative design intention scenarios. Secondly, the knowledge graph technology is used to unify the management and representation of product iterative design knowledge. Thirdly, the knowledge graph for the iterative design process is constructed oriented to the iterative feedback requirements based on FBS(Function-Behavior-Structure) and knowledge complexity calculation to determine the KDA(Knowledge Demand Anchor).

It covers more than 5000 terms hierarchically organized into a directed acyclic graph and known functional annotations. Automatically annotating protein functions by using GO-based computational models has been an area of active research for a long time. However, due to the limited functional annotation information and complex topological structures of GO, existing models cannot effectively capture the knowledge representation of GO. To solve this issue, we present a method that fuses the functional and topological knowledge of GO to guide protein function prediction. This method employs a multi-view GCN model to extract a variety of GO representations from functional information, topological structure, and their combinations. To dynamically learn the significance weights of these representations, it adopts an attention mechanism to learn the final knowledge representation of GO. Furthermore, it uses a pre-trained language model (i.e., ESM-1b) to efficiently learn biological features for each protein sequence. Finally, it obtains all predicted scores by calculating the dot product of sequence features and GO representation. Our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, as demonstrated by the experimental results on datasets from three different species, namely Yeast, Human and Arabidopsis.

| No             |          | Prediction of treatment outcome for repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in major depressive disorder using connectivity measures and ensemble of pre-trained deep learning models                   | Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) can be used as an effective treatment for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) especially when a patient does not respond to multiple antidepressants. However, the prediction of the treatment outcome of rTMS is a vital task to prevent starting an inefficient treatment which may waste several important weeks for the patient and clinic. In the present study, we acquired 19-channel Electro-Encephalogram (EEG) for 34 MDD patients diagnosed with drug-resistant Depression before initiating rTMS treatment. Effective Connectivity matrix was obtained from four frequency bands of EEG signal to create connectivity images which, simultaneously, represent spatial and frequency information of EEG signals. Then, we investigated five powerful pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) named VGG16, Xception, InceptionResNetV2, DenseNet121, and EfficientNetB0 as Transfer Learning (TL) models to predict rTMS treatment outcome by discriminating Responders and NonResponders. VGG16 and DenseNet121 achieved the best performance with an accuracy of 89.22%. Additionally, we developed a new ensemble model based on all pre-trained CNN models using a weighted majority voting approach. The Differential Evolution Optimization (DEO) algorithm is used to find the optimal weights for the ensemble model and the mean accuracy of 92.28% was obtained. The superior performance of the optimized ensemble of these pre-trained CNN models, using effective connectivity images obtained from EEG signals, shows that the proposed method is highly capable of predicting the treatment outcome of rTMS. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

There exists multiple graph-based prior biological knowledge about omics data, such as gene-gene interaction networks. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in introducing graph neural networks (GNNs) into multi-omics learning. However, existing methods have not fully exploited these graphical priors since none have been able to integrate knowledge from multiple sources simultaneously. To solve this problem, we propose a multi-omics data analysis framework by incorporating multiple prior knowledge into graph neural network (MPK-GNN). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to introduce multiple prior graphs into multi-omics data analysis. Specifically, the proposed method contains four parts: (1) a feature-level learning module to aggregate information from prior graphs; (2) a projection module to maximize the agreement among prior networks by optimizing a contrastive loss; (3) a sample-level module to learn a global representation from input multi-omics features; (4) a task-specific module to flexibly extend MPK-GNN for various downstream multi-omics analysis tasks. Finally, we verify the effectiveness of the proposed multi-omics learning algorithm on the cancer molecular subtype classification task. Experimental results show that MPK-GNN outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms, including multi-view learning methods and multi-omics integrative approaches. © 2013 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

This paper proposes a depression detection method based on image data that introduces frequency attention. In response to the problem of existing methods that use auxiliary information to improve performance but significantly increase computational costs, this method first applies adaptive gamma correction and deblurring data enhancement to the original data based on three universal characteristics of image data (information sparsity, inter-domain difference, and infinite granularity). Next, in accordance with the frequency richness characteristic unique to depression images, a transformer network with frequency attention is introduced for training. Finally, a pre-trained fine-tuning training strategy is used to address the problem of overfitting due to the small size of the dataset. This method achieved an RMSE of 7.36 and an MAE of 5.97 on the AVEC2013 dataset and 7.23 RMSE and 5.85 MAE on the AVEC2014 dataset. Sufficient experiments have shown that the combination of data enhancement and frequency attention in image-based depression detection is effective and promising.

| No             |          | Development of an OWL Ontology Based on the Function-Oriented System Architecture to Support Data Synchronization Between SysML and Domain Models                                                            | A promising approach to systems engineering is called Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), which is increasingly accepted to support the development process of complex systems. In MBSE,engineers use Systems Modeling Language (SysML) for formalized modeling of function-oriented system architecture and solution architecture that enable the integration of various domain models to support a seamless system development process. Domain models simulate the physical behaviors of systems with design parameters so as to realize the quantitative analysis and verification of systems. These design parameters often exist in multiple heterogeneous data sources and often rely on manual importation into the SysML model. However, when systems become complex with a large data volume, manual data exchanges between multiple data sources and SysML models become time-consuming and error-prone. Therefore, this work proposes an ontology based on Web Ontology Language (OWL) for managing data in a standardized way and solving heterogeneous problems. Then, an automatic synchronization mechanism is established between the ontology and the SysML model for easy exchange of data. This work demonstrates and validates the proposed approach with a case study of a technical system (i.e., wind turbine system). The contribution of this work is the creation of a standardized OWL ontology that supports an automatic synchronization between the data from multiple domain models and the SysML models, thus reducing the manual effort of dealing with heterogeneous data sources and the risk of data inconsistency occurring in manual data transmission.

| No             |          | TeaBERT: An Efficient Knowledge Infused Cross-Lingual Language Model for Mapping Chinese Medical Entities to the Unified Medical Language System                                                             | Medical entity normalization is an important task for medical information processing. The Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), a well-developed medical terminology system, is crucial for medical entity normalization. However, the UMLS primarily consists of English medical terms. For languages other than English, such as Chinese, a significant challenge for normalizing medical entities is the lack of robust terminology systems. To address this issue, we propose a translation-enhancing training strategy that incorporates the translation and synonym knowledge of the UMLS into a language model using the contrastive learning approach. In this work, we proposed a cross-lingual pre-trained language model called TeaBERT, which can align synonymous Chinese and English medical entities across languages at the concept level. As the evaluation results showed, the TeaBERT language model outperformed previous cross-lingual language models with Acc@5 values of 92.54%, 87.14% and 84.77% on the ICD10-CN, CHPO and RealWorld-v2 datasets, respectively. It also achieved a new state-of-the-art cross-lingual entity mapping performance without fine-tuning. The translation-enhancing strategy is applicable to other languages that face the similar challenge due to the absence of well-developed medical terminology systems. © 2013 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Future cross-manufacturer app stores for IoT applications will require that the strong coupling of hardware and software is loosened. In the resulting IoT applications, a quintessential challenge is the effective and efficient deployment of IoT software components across variable networks of heterogeneous devices. Current research focuses on computing whether deployment requirements fit the intended target devices instead of assisting users in successfully deploying IoT applications by suggesting deployment requirement relaxations or hardware alternatives. This can make successfully deploying large-scale IoT applications a costly trial-and-error endeavor. To mitigate this, we have devised a method for providing such deployment suggestions based on search and backtracking. This can make deploying IoT applications more effective and more efficient, which, ultimately, eases reducing the complexity of deploying the software surrounding us. © 2022 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

There are several reasons for this, including the lack of large collections of good quality models, the difficulty to label models due to the required domain expertise, and the relative immaturity of the application of ML to MDE. In this work, we present ModelSet, a labelled dataset of software models intended to enable the application of ML to address software modelling problems. To create it we have devised a method designed to facilitate the exploration and labelling of model datasets by interactively grouping similar models using off-the-shelf technologies like a search engine. We have built an Eclipse plug-in to support the labelling process, which we have used to label 5,466 Ecore meta-models and 5,120 UML models with its category as the main label plus additional secondary labels of interest. We have evaluated the ability of our labelling method to create meaningful groups of models in order to speed up the process, improving the effectiveness of classical clustering methods. We showcase the usefulness of the dataset by applying it in a real scenario: enhancing the MAR search engine. We use ModelSet to train models able to infer useful metadata to navigate search results.

| No             |          | ChestXRayBERT: A Pretrained Language Model for Chest Radiology Report Summarization                                                                                                                          | Automatically generating the 'impression' section of a radiology report given the 'findings' section can summarize as much salient information of the 'findings' section as possible, thus promoting more effective communication between radiologists and referring physicians. To significantly reduce the workload of radiologists, we develop and evaluate a novel framework of abstractive summarization methods to automatically generate the 'impression' section of chest radiology reports. Despite recent advancements in natural language process (NLP) field such as BERT and its variants, existing abstractive summarization models and methods could not be directly applied to radiology reports, partly due to domain-specific radiology terminology. In response, we develop a pre-trained language model in the chest radiology domain, named ChestXRayBERT, to solve the problem of automatically summarizing chest radiology reports. Specifically, we first collect radiology-related scientific papers as pre-training corpus and pre-train a ChestXRayBERT on it. Then, an abstractive summarization model is proposed, which consists of the pre-trained ChestXRayBERT and a Transformer decoder. Finally, the model is fine-tuned on chest X-ray reports for the abstractive summarization task. When evaluated on the publicly available OPEN-I and MIMIC-CXR datasets, the performance of our proposed model achieves significant improvement compared with other neural networks-based abstractive summarization models. In general, the proposed ChestXRayBERT demonstrates the feasibility and promise of tailoring and extending advanced NLP techniques to the domain of medical imaging and radiology, as well as in the broader biomedicine and healthcare fields in the future. © 1999-2012 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| No             |          | Towards Memory-Efficient Validation of Large XMI Models                                                                                                                                                      | Model validation is a common activity in model-driven engineering, where a model is checked against a set of consistency rules (also referred to as constraints) to assess whether it has desirable properties further to those that can be expressed by the metamodel that it conforms to (e.g. to check that all states in a state machine are reachable or that no classes in an object-oriented model are involved in circular inheritance relationships). Such constraints can be written in general-purpose (e.g. Java) or in task-specific validation languages such as the Object Constraint Language (OCL) or the Epsilon Validation Language (EVL). To check a model that is serialised in the OMG-standard XMI format against a set of constraints, the current state of practice requires loading the entire model into memory first. This can be problematic in cases where loading the model into memory requires more memory (heap space) than is available in the host machine, and is sub-optimal when carrying out distributed model validation over a number of machines. In this paper, we present an approach that uses static analysis to split sets of model validation constraints into sub-groups that operate on smaller subsets of the model. Combined with existing XMI partial loading capabilities, the proposed approach makes it possible to check larger XMI - based models on a single machine and to potentially improve efficiency when checking models in a distributed setting. © 2023 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

This is more evident in collaborative environments, where the stream of changes applied to models by different engineers is constant and unanticipated. These changes can cause multiple inconsistencies that must be fixed while preserving the changes applied. However, performing this task is not trivial, as analyzing the changes and the possible large amount of repair alternatives requires time and effort. In this work, we present an approach that aids this repair process by analyzing the stream of changes (i.e., history of changes) while exploring repair alternatives alongside their side effects. The approach generates repairs for inconsistencies identified in the model. These repairs are explored by simulating their execution while re-analyzing the model to find potential new inconsistencies created. Then, new repairs are generated to fix these new inconsistencies. This cycle repeats until the model reaches a consistent state or until repairs can no longer be generated. The approach also analyzes conflicts between repairs and changes. This analysis brings valuable information to engineers regarding how each repair alternative would impact their models and may conflict with changes as well as other repairs. We evaluated our approach in a set of 11 UML models that contain a history of changes. Our findings show how our approach can be applied in a variety of models with a different number of model elements and inconsistencies within a reasonable amount of time. © 2022 ACM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

As a system architecture design formalism method, model-based systems engineering (MBSE) provides capable support in the design process of complex systems. In this paper, a cloud-based manufacturing service value net system is proposed to help manufacturing enterprises coordinate with partners. However, in this cross-organization collaborative activities, experts with different domain backgrounds are familiar with various system specifications and modeling languages, which makes it extremely hard for related stakeholders to collaborate and conduct information interaction. Therefore, this article presents a semantic modeling method of GOPPRR and unified ontology modeling karma language to support different MBSE standards. The specific domain meta-models of manufacturing service value net system are developed throughout the whole lifecycle process. MetaGraph tool is applied to build meta-models and models. Karma codes with consistent semantics can be generated automatically in real time no matter what modeling language is taken. Concretely, an instantiated modeling case was created in the basic of developed meta-model library. This paper conducts ongoing research for system design in the manufacturing service field, and the proposed modeling method also implies reference significance for designing of similar systems. © 2023 CEUR-WS.

Beyond their ability to help software professionals write more accurate, reusable code, MDE frameworks could make programming accessible for a new class of domain experts. However, domain experts have been slow to embrace these tools, as they still need to learn how to specify their applications' requirements using the concrete syntax (i.e., textual or graphical) of the new and unified domain-specific language. Conversational interfaces (chatbots) could smooth the learning process and offer a more interactive way for domain experts to specify their application requirements and generate the desired code. If integrated with MDE frameworks, chatbots may offer domain experts with richer domain vocabulary without sacrificing the power of agnosticism that unified modelling frameworks provide. In this paper, we discuss the challenges of integrating chatbots within MDE frameworks and then examine a specific application: The auto-generation of smart contract code based on conversational syntax. We demonstrate how this can be done and evaluate our approach by conducting a user experience survey to assess the usability and functionality of the chatbot framework. The paper concludes by drawing attention to the potential benefits of leveraging Language Models (LLMs) in this context. © 2023 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

A Comparative Study of Large Language Models for Taxonomy Construction                                                                                                             | Taxonomies represent hierarchical relations between entities, frequently applied in various software modeling and natural language processing (NLP) activities. They are typically subject to a set of structural constraints restricting their content. However, manual taxonomy construction can be time-consuming, incomplete, and costly to maintain. Recent studies of large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated that appropriate user inputs (called prompting) can effectively guide LLMs, such as GPT-3, in diverse NLP tasks without explicit (re-)training. However, existing approaches for automated taxonomy construction typically involve fine-tuning a language model by adjusting model parameters. In this paper, we present a general framework for taxonomy construction that takes into account structural constraints. We subsequently conduct a systematic comparison between the prompting and fine-tuning approaches performed on a hypernym taxonomy and a novel computer science taxonomy dataset. Our result reveals the following: (1) Even without explicit training on the dataset, the prompting approach outperforms fine-tuning-based approaches. Moreover, the performance gap between prompting and fine-tuning widens when the training dataset is small. However, (2) taxonomies generated by the fine-tuning approach can be easily post-processed to satisfy all the constraints, whereas handling violations of the taxonomies produced by the prompting approach can be challenging. These evaluation findings provide guidance on selecting the appropriate method for taxonomy construction and highlight potential enhancements for both approaches. © 2023 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

In MBSE, systems are split into multiple sub-systems and the relevant physical phenomena are described via analytical or numerical models. When a significant number of design variables are to be considered, a smart approach to reduce the number of analyses to perform would be to make use of the Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) to higlight those variables that have a more significant influence on the system output. Moreover, an even more significant reduction of computational cost to perform the GSA can be achieved if the complex system modelled via the MBSE approach is exported under the Functional Mock-Up Interface (FMI) norm. In this context, this paper proposes an original approach to address the study of two constructive solutions of an acceleration measuring device typically used on airbags for which the use of a new solution characterized by a porous material is compared with a classical one. © The Author(s), 2023.

Problem: the creation of Internet of Things solutions is fairly complex, having to integrate and communicate between sensors, devices, and larger systems, presenting many technical challenges not present in the same magnitude as other paradigms. One of the most affected segments is the development of cyber-physical devices. Much of its development energy is spent on the connecting and efficacy of these devices, often overlooking the future impacts of the proposed solution, caused by a lack of software quality. SI Theory: this work was designed under the Design Theory, currently found in the Justify/Evaluate stage's refinement process. Methodology: model-driven development (MDD), a software development methodology that allows the generation of software solutions through abstract models, which aims to facilitate development, bringing the abstract solution closer to the problem's implementation. In this work, a custom MDD approach for cyber-physical devices is presented. Results: the proposed approach and tool were able to generate C++ source code for Arduino devices, the generated source code performed better than control when compared using OOP specific software metrics. Contributions: this study presents an MDD approach for cyber-physical devices, where the innovative models are based and coupled to the hardware specifications, being extensible and flexible. © 2022 ACM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

With the rapid development of high-throughput technologies, an abundance of proteins are discovered. However, the gap between proteins and function annotations is still huge. To accelerate the process of protein function prediction, some computational methods taking advantage of multiple data have been proposed. Among these methods, the deep-learning-based methods are currently the most popular for their capability of learning information automatically from raw data. However, due to the diversity and scale difference between data, it is challenging for existing deep learning methods to capture related information from different data effectively. In this paper, we introduce a deep learning method that can adaptively learn information from protein sequences and biomedical literature, namely DeepAF. DeepAF first extracts the two kinds of information by using different extractors, which are built based on pre-trained language models and can capture rudimentary biological knowledge. Then, to integrate those information, it performs an adaptive fusion layer based on a Cross-attention mechanism that considers the knowledge of mutual interactions between two information. Finally, based on the mixed information, DeepAF utilizes logistic regression to obtain prediction scores. The experimental results on the datasets of two species (i.e., Human and Yeast) show that DeepAF outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches. © 2022 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Phenotyping and relevance classification of prevalent but underdiagnosed conditions from clinical notes using Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods has been an effective way to learn valuable clinical insights as well as for performance on multiple clinical domain-specific NLP tasks. Recent NLP advancements in using self-supervision techniques with transformer architectures, such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), pioneered a new standard of contextual representation for fine-tuning models toward domain-specific tasks. However, supervised fine-tuning of neural models typically requires too many labeled samples to feasibly annotate entirely manually, constricting most research in clinical applications to shared, general purpose datasets. In this work, we propose using distant supervision to generate adequate data for training transformer-based language models for MDD-relatedness sentence classification. We evaluate the performance of two transformer instances - BERT and Bio-clinical BERT - for classifying sentences into one of four classes representing different MDD concept contexts, then compare against three traditional machine learning baseline models. The Bio-Clinical BERT model, pre-trained on biomedical abstracts then further on clinical domain corpora, achieved the highest F1-score for all class labels. Our results show that the neural language models, especially those with relevant domain-based pretraining, are superior at discerning semantic contexts and that distant supervision is an effective tactic for improving the accuracy of the pretrained transformer models. © 2023 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

The novelty of this classifier lies in its application to a meta-model for GLML that deviates from the simple graph model and underlies a large number of GLML. The main goal of using this classification scheme is to support the reuse of layout algorithms for GLML. GLML are used directly or indirectly for the development of software by model-based software engineering techniques. In other domains, graph-like models are artifacts (e.g., circuit diagrams, energy flow diagrams) that serve as input for downstream specialized applications (simulators, optimizers). The concrete syntax of a language for creating, editing, and understanding models is highly important for the development of modeling tools. Layout methods for the used languages have to be implemented to achieve software tools with good usability. Developing layout algorithms is a complex topic that is covered by the specialized field of Graph Drawing. However, there is no existing procedure to determine which layout algorithm can be used for a GLML. Matching layout algorithms to GLML can be achieved by applying the presented classification scheme. © 2023, The Author(s).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

When modelling the behaviour, complex expressions, and fine details of a domain, often it does not make sense to use a graphical syntax, as this can result in large, crowded diagrams, therefore in such cases, a textual syntax is often more appropriate. As such, the best of both worlds can be delivered by a DSL that has hybrid (part-graphical and part-textual) syntaxes. In this work, we address open challenges and apply model-driven engineering techniques to streamline the development of hybrid graphical-textual model editors for DSLs, by using as little hand-written code as possible. © 2023, Journal of Object Technology.

Because it is expensive and labor-intensive to experimentally screen ion channel-modulating peptides (IMPs), in-silico approaches can serve as excellent alternatives. In this study, we present PrIMP, prediction models for screening IMPs that can target sodium, potassium, and calcium ion channels, as well as nicotine acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). To overcome the data insufficiency of the IMPs, we utilized two types of knowledge transfer approaches: multi-task learning (MTL) and transfer learning (TL). MTL enabled model training for four target tasks simultaneously with hard parameter sharing, thereby increasing model generalization. TL transferred knowledge of pre-trained model weights from antimicrobial peptide data, which was a much larger, naturally-occurring functional peptide dataset that could potentially improve the model performance. MTL and TL successfully improved the prediction performance of prediction models. In addition, a hybrid approach by implementing deep learning along with traditional machine learning was utilized, with additional performance improvements. PrIMP achieved F1 scores of 0.924 (sodium ion channel), 0.937 (potassium ion channel), 0.898 (calcium ion channel), and 0.931 (nAChRs).

However, current personalized strategies require accurate models or large amounts of training data, which are not suitable for soft exoskeletons due to human-robot interaction uncertainties and low data acquisition efficiency. This paper presents a framework of Model-Agnostic Personalized Knowledge Adaptation (MPKA) consisting of two modules of Soft-to-Rigid Kinematics Model (SRKM) and Data-Driven Personalized Adaptation (DDPA) to generate a personalized strategy. Specifically, the first SRKM module is used to simplify and convert uncertain and time-varying HRI model to a certain and fixed model. The second DDPA module is used to accelerate model adaptation to new individuals using meta-learning with less data, based on the learned knowledge from the previous subjects. The experiments were conducted on three different sized platforms, four healthy and one post-stroke subjects, respectively. The results demonstrate that the MPKA can generate personalized models for new individuals more rapidly with less data than a pre-trained neural network, and the personalized models can obtain better control accuracy by over 62% than mechanism-based mathematical model.

In previous work, we have introduced multi-version models for model-driven software engineering, which allow checking well-formedness and finding merge conflicts for multiple versions of a model at once. However, also for multi-version models, situations where different artifacts, that is, different models, are linked via automatic model transformations have to be handled.In this paper, we propose a technique for jointly handling the transformation of multiple versions of a source model into corresponding versions of a target model, which enables the use of a more compact representation that may afford improved execution time of both the transformation and further analysis operations. Our approach is based on the well-known formalism of triple graph grammars and the aforementioned encoding of model version histories called multi-version models. In addition to batch transformation of an entire model version history, the technique also covers incremental synchronization of changes in the framework of multi-version models.We show the correctness of our approach with respect to the standard semantics of triple graph grammars and conduct an empirical evaluation to investigate the performance of our technique regarding execution time and memory consumption. Our results indicate that the proposed technique affords lower memory consumption and may improve execution time for batch transformation of large version histories, but can also come with computational overhead in unfavorable cases. © 2023 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

We introduce the Unified Multiple-Choice (UniMC) framework, which is format-independent, compatible with various formats, and applicable to tasks like text classification and sentiment analysis. Furthermore, we design a two-stage tuning method, initially training on multiple-choice formats to develop format-agnostic capabilities, and subsequently enabling direct predictions on unseen tasks for zero-shot learning. Our methodology avoids issues in large-scale models like FLAN, enhancing generalization and reducing parameters. In experiments, UniMC shows State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance across out-of-domain and in-domain benchmarks, with only 235M parameters, far fewer than previous methods. Moreover, the UniMC-Chinese model excels beyond human performance on benchmarks like EPRSTMT and CHID-FC, underscoring its generalization capacity across languages. Additionally, ablation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our design.

Although existing re-identification (re-ID) solutions of occluded pedestrians have made significant progress, most of them achieve accurate identity matching by extracting pedestrian appearance features from unoccluded areas. However, when a pedestrian is partially blocked by the body of another pedestrian, existing methods cannot accurately determine whether the unoccluded body parts belong to the target pedestrian, which brings great difficulties to pedestrian identity matching. To alleviate this problem, this paper introduces the idea of adversarial attack into occluded person re-ID and proposes an adversarial training framework that can defend against attacks from obstacles to resist the interference of obstacles on pedestrian identity matching. Unlike existing solutions, the proposed framework is not limited to extracting features of unoccluded human body areas to achieve occluded person re-ID, but explores how to make the re-ID model more resistant to obstacles. In the proposed framework, the occluded pedestrian images are regarded as adversarial examples and used to attack model training. If the trained model can defend against this kind of attack, its generalization is significantly improved, and the above-mentioned issues are also effectively solved. Specifically, a single-branch dual-stream collaborative network is designed. With the cooperation of the pre-trained verification guidance network, the model realizes the attack and defense of adversarial samples. This work broadens research horizons in robust model design of occluded person re-ID, and expands the scope of adversarial attacks. Compared with existing solutions, a lot of experimental results confirm that the proposed solution achieves better performance on two occluded re-ID datasets and two partial re-ID datasets. © 2005-2012 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

To accomplish such efficacious interaction, the next-generation AEI needs comprehensive human emotion models for training. Unlike theory of emotion, which has been the historical focus in psychology, emotion models are a descriptive tool. In practice, the strongest models need robust coverage, which means defining the smallest core set of emotions from which all others can be derived. To achieve the desired coverage, we turn to word embeddings from natural language processing. Using unsupervised clustering techniques, our experiments show that with as few as 15 discrete emotion categories, we can provide maximum coverage across six major languages&#x2013;Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Spanish, and Russian. In support of our findings, we also examine annotations from two large-scale emotion recognition datasets to assess the validity of existing emotion models compared to human perception at scale. Because robust, comprehensive emotion models are foundational for developing real-world affective computing applications, this work has broad implications in social robotics, human-machine interaction, mental healthcare, computational psychology, and entertainment.

Traditional deep language models, on the basis of dense word representations, requires large memory space and computing resource. The brain-inspired neuromorphic computing systems, with the advantages of better biological interpretability and less energy consumption, still have major difficulties in the representation of words in terms of neuronal activities, which has restricted their further application in more complicated downstream language tasks. Comprehensively exploring the diverse neuronal dynamics of both integration and resonance, we probe into three spiking neuron models to post-process the original dense word embeddings, and test the generated sparse temporal codes on several tasks concerning both word-level and sentence-level semantics. The experimental results show that our sparse binary word representations could perform on par with or even better than original word embeddings in capturing semantic information, while requiring less storage. Our methods provide a robust representation foundation of language in terms of neuronal activities, which could potentially be applied to future downstream natural language tasks under neuromorphic computing systems.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data analysis may provide insight into individual patient responses, allowing for more customized treatment decisions. Due to the absence of brain MRI data for MDD patients, a transfer learning (TL) method developed is used using calculation criteria. Combining an Inception-v3 neural network with a typical pre-trained neural network, the move learning-based Inception-v3 was proposed for the classification of MDD MRI datasets. An experiment was performed on the classification of eight semantic emotions (defined by IMAPS). Compared to other methods, the proposed method performs high efficiency for 90–10% and 80–20% (positive and negative classes), normal (N), unnormal (UN), and average/total sets, and for 70–30%, accuracy (A) is 92.90%, area under the curve (AUC) is 94.23%, and average precision score (APS) is 95.75%. Individual patients' responses to emotional stimulation can be predicted using the proposed methods, which can provide guidance in diagnosis and prognosis. © 2022 The Authors.

This means new methods for engineering flexible production systems, the interconnection between production system, process, and product, need to occur, as contemporary methods are reaching their limits. While varying approaches try to address this problem on a small-scale, the need for holistic methodologies becomes obvious. Thus, this paper proposes a holistic solution by aligning the concepts of the Product, Process, and Resource (PPR) notation for engineering industrial systems according to the Reference Architecture Model Industrie 4.0 (RAMI 4.0). By doing so, each other's disadvantages are counteracted. In more detail, RAMI 4.0 is missing a concrete modeling notation allowing it to be practically applied in systems engineering. At the same time, PPR reaches its limits regarding large-scale modeling systems across multiple domains or granularity levels. The result of this work, an applicable PPR modeling notation for engineering complex production systems, could strongly contribute to future Model-based Systems Engineering (MBSE) within this area, as a ready-to-use methodology the so-called RAMI Toolbox provides them. Using the agile design science research methodology (ADSRM), the outcome is evaluated based on a real-world case study. © 2023 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

The use of robust M&S formalisms and rigorous methodologies is essential to deal with complexity. Among them, the Discrete Event System Specification (DEVS) provides a solid framework for modeling structural, behavior and information aspects of any complex system. This gives several advantages to analyze and design complex systems: completeness, verifiability, extensibility, and maintainability. DEVS formalism has been implemented in many programming languages and executable on multiple platforms. In this paper, we describe the features of an M&S framework called xDEVS that builds upon the prevalent DEVS Application Programming Interface (API) for both modeling and simulation layers, promoting interoperability between the existing platform-specific (C++, Java, Python) DEVS implementations. Additionally, the framework can simulate the same model using sequential, parallel, or distributed architectures. The M&S engine has been reinforced with several strategies to improve performance, as well as tools to perform model analysis and verification. Finally, xDEVS also facilitates systems engineers to apply the vision of model-based systems engineering (MBSE), model-driven engineering (MDE), and model-driven systems engineering (MDSE) paradigms. We highlight the features of the proposed xDEVS framework with multiple examples and case studies illustrating the rigor and diversity of application domains it can support. © 2022 The Authors.

SaaS products are large, distributed software systems hosted in cloud and built using collaborating services (or micro-services). The software releases happen in days and weeks, necessitating an agile development process. Novice engineers (those who join the company fresh from college) need to become comfortable with complex systems and proficient in agile delivery with high quality, otherwise they fall behind in productivity. The paper posits that, to be successful at these SaaS product companies, the novice engineers need good modeling and design skills. While this has been for all software development, the changes driven by SaaS products have made this need more acute. Such skills will allow them to capture their feature behaviors (in context of their understanding of the larger product) in an implementation-independent manner and any knowledge gaps can be identified and bridged by their collaborators. We propose a modeling language that is easy for them to learn and use, and which has characteristics suitable for the kind of engineering work they need to do in their early years in a SaaS product company. This modeling language is based on the notion of Transition Systems. The paper demonstrates the usage and value of this language by creating a model for a real feature. The modeling language is quite general and transcends abstraction boundaries. We also present a modeling process that should be used with this language for better results. This is a short position paper that presents an idea about a new modeling language for a specific purpose (helping novice engineers design well at SaaS product companies). Validation studies for the language and the design process is a work in progress and the results will be shared in a full paper later. © 2023 ACM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

However, significant clothes image variations degrade visual search retrieval accuracy. Another problem with retrieval accuracy is the high dimensions of feature vectors obtained from pre-trained deep CNN models. This research aims to enhance clothes retrieval training and test accuracy by using two different means. Initially, features are extracted using the modified AlexNet (M-AlexNet) with slight modification. The ReLU activation function is replaced with a self-regularized Mish activation function because of its non-monotonic nature. The M-AlexNet with Mish is trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset using the SoftMax classifier. Another contribution is to reduce the dimensions of feature vectors obtained from M-AlexNet. The dimensions of features are reduced by selecting the top k -ranked features and removing some of the different features using the proposed Joint Shannon's Entropy Pearson Correlation Coefficient (JSE-PCC) technique to enhance the clothes retrieval performance. To calculate the efficacy of suggested methods, the comparison is performed with other deep CNN models such as baseline AlexNet, VGG-16, VGG-19, and ResNet50 on DeepFashion2, MVC, and the proposed Clothes Image Dataset (CID). Extensive experiments indicate that AlexNet with Mish attains 85.15%, 82.04%, and 83.65% accuracy on DeepFashion2, MVC, and 83.65% on CID datasets. Hence, M-AlexNet and the proposed feature selection technique surpassed the results with a margin of 5.11% on DeepFashion2, 1.95% on MVC, and 3.51% on CID datasets. © 2013 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

Absent source code, understanding binaries' behavior can be quite challenging, especially when compiled under higher levels of compiler optimization. These optimizations can transform comprehensible, 'natural' source constructions into something entirely unrecognizable. Reverse engineering binaries, especially those suspected of being malevolent or guilty of intellectual property theft, are important and time-consuming tasks. There is a great deal of interest in tools to 'decompile' binaries back into more natural source code to aid reverse engineering. Decompilation involves several desirable steps, including recreating source-language constructions, variable names, and perhaps even comments. One central step in creating binaries is optimizing function calls, using steps such as inlining. Recovering these (possibly inlined) function calls from optimized binaries is an essential task that most state-of-the-art decompiler tools try to do but do not perform very well. In this paper, we evaluate a supervised learning approach to the problem of recovering optimized function calls. We leverage open-source software and develop an automated labeling scheme to generate a reasonably large dataset of binaries labeled with actual function usages. We augment this large but limited labeled dataset with a pre-training step, which learns the decompiled code statistics from a much larger unlabeled dataset. Thus augmented, our learned labeling model can be combined with an existing decompilation tool, Ghidra, to achieve substantially improved performance in function call recovery, especially at higher levels of optimization. © 1976-2012 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

In terms of absolute emissions, India surpassed China and the U.S. in 2018 to become the third-largest emitter. Solving this wicked problem calls for climate action across the stakeholder spectrum involving governments, business communities, and citizens. While extant literature has focused significantly on the role of governments and individual perceptions, the business sector needs to be more represented. In this study, we consider business news media as a platform that reflects the industry engagement in climate change and as a source of information on climate change for business decision-makers. Hence, understanding the topic and themes in the nexus of climate and business is important to evaluate the business sector's stance towards climate change and how it has evolved. This work explores business news related to climate change using natural language techniques. We first experiment with three topic-modeling techniques, such as LDA, NMF, and BERTopic, on the business news and two more benchmark news datasets. Our test data is derived from digital news archives of 'The Economic Times- India's leading business news daily. We evaluate the performance based on quantitative metrics commonly used for topic models. We choose the algorithm that provides the highest precision for climate-specific information represented by the test dataset. We then apply the algorithm with the best performance, as evaluated by the experiment, to a large corpus of Indian climate news from E.T. spanning from 2008 -2021. We present how different themes, including industry engagement, evolved over the last two decades. The results suggest that climate cooperation has the highest contribution in the corpus, with other themes on resource management, energy and business gaining traction in recent years. © 2013 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

A DSML has specific static and dynamic behavior rules that must be properly assessed before processing the model. The definition of these rules remains a challenge. Meta-modeling techniques usually lack the foundational elements required to fully express behavioral semantics. In this context, using an interactive theorem prover provides a mathematical foundation with which the semantics of a DSML can be defined. This includes an abstract syntax tree, typing rules, and derivation of an executable simulator. In this paper, we report on an ongoing effort to capture the SAE AADL language using Coq along with specific analysis capabilities. Our contribution provides an unambiguous semantics for a large set of the language and can be used as a foundation to build rich analysis capabilities. © 2022 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

However, these advantages are often misused by some publishers to disseminate fake information rapidly, thereby adversely affecting individuals and societies. Thus, the early detection of fake posts is crucial. Developing an automatic content-based fake news detector is the ideal way to overcome this issue. Given that the generation rate of news in social media is drastic and the labeling of a huge amount of data required by fully supervised models is expensive and time consuming, these models are not beneficial in real applications. To address this limitation, this study presents a semi-supervised method by utilizing an ensemble of diverse deep learners, effective augmentations, and a distribution-aware pseudo-labeling technique. Here, the proposed hybrid loss function enforces the learners to have accurate classification performance while attending to different parts of news content. Moreover, the proposed augmentations enhance the robustness of learners and prevent overfitting effectively. Diverse learners are utilized to annotate the unlabeled posts accurately and update their parameters from the most confident predicted news in a curriculum way, thereby enhancing the quality of pseudo labels and the robustness of the model. Moreover, we utilize encoded sentences from pre-trained transformer models, such as XLNET, and parameter sharing to build light learners on a common deep feature extractor module. Consequently, while the number of parameters is less than that of the existing methods, experiments conducted on three public fake news datasets reveal that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models with different proportions of labeled data across all evaluated datasets. © 2013 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| No             |          | Advantages and disadvantages of (dedicated) model transformation languages: A qualitative interview study                                                                                                    | Context: Model driven development envisages the use of model transformations to evolve models. Model transformation languages, developed for this task, are touted with many benefits over general purpose programming languages. However, a large number of these claims have not yet been substantiated. They are also made without the context necessary to be able to critically assess their merit or built meaningful empirical studies around them. Objective: The objective of our work is to elicit the reasoning, influences and background knowledge that lead people to assume benefits or drawbacks of model transformation languages. Method: We conducted a large-scale interview study involving 56 participants from research and industry. Interviewees were presented with claims about model transformation languages and were asked to provide reasons for their assessment thereof. We qualitatively analysed the responses to find factors that influence the properties of model transformation languages as well as explanations as to how exactly they do so. Results: Our interviews show, that general purpose expressiveness of GPLs, domain specific capabilities of MTLs as well as tooling all have strong influences on how people view properties of model transformation languages. Moreover, the Choice of MTL, the Use Case for which a transformation should be developed as well as the Skill s of involved stakeholders have a moderating effect on the influences, by changing the context to consider. Conclusion: There is a broad body of experience, that suggests positive and negative influences for properties of MTLs. Our data suggests, that much needs to be done in order to convey the viability of model transformation languages. Efforts to provide more empirical substance need to be undergone and lacklustre language capabilities and tooling need to be improved upon. We suggest several approaches for this that can be based on the results of the presented study. © 2022, The Author(s).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

PPG technology is widely used in a variety of wearable sensors to investigate the cardiovascular system. Recent studies have demonstrated the utility of PPG analysis for carrying out large-scale screening to prevent and detect diabetes. However, most of these studies require feature extraction and/or several pre-processing steps. Over the past few years, the advent of deep learning has significantly impacted the analysis of biomedical signals. Despite their success in other fields, however, very few studies have focused on the application of deep learning to raw PPG signals for detecting diabetes. Existing studies have proposed large models trained on large amounts of data. In this paper, we present a Light CNN-based model for screening the presence of type 2 diabetes using a single raw pulse extracted from photoplethysmographic signals. In addition to the baseline architecture, we evaluate different model architectures that take as input age and biological sex or PPG handcrafted features. Furthermore, we apply transfer learning to all the tested architectures to evaluate the effectiveness of harnessing pre-trained models in detecting diabetes. We tested a model pre-trained on a general PPG shape dataset and another model pre-trained on a dataset containing hypertension PPG signals. Our model scored an AUC of 75.5 when trained with raw PPG waves, age, and biological sex without applying transfer learning, which is competitive with current state of the art. © 2023 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Stakeholder needs should be satisfied while product and architecture design need to be consistent with user requirements in all stages during the whole product lifecycle. In this paper, satellite network as an example of complex system is modeled in a reusable, reconfigurable and efficient manner using the system modeling language (SysML) together with pattern viewpoints and simulation constructs. Based upon abstract syntax described using metamodels and a set of profiles, concept reusability is established for the specific domain. Additionally a reusable modeling framework is developed with tailored design patterns and multiple viewpoints. Analysis metamodel, profile and interface are further presented to preserve reusability during iterations among multiple optimization rounds. A novel satellite network simulation model is formulated and multi-objective optimization is solved by transformation under practical application scenarios. A set of metrics are designed to assess and validate the models. Results show that the proposed reusable model has viewpoint coverage of more than 80 percent compared to a half for the baseline OOSEM model. The proposed model thus covers the pattern viewpoints and ontologies in a wider and more frequent way and is more efficient. Design choices made based on the model can be incorporated into this mechanism which is extensible along the system lifespan.

To solve this problem, researchers propose MBSE(Model-Based Systems Engineering) and its standard system language SysML. At present, there are not many system modeling tools, and their scalability and quality need to be improved. This paper explores the design and testing of MOF(Meta Object Facility) based on the command pattern, trying to improve the expansibility and software quality of SysML modeling tools. Firstly, the MOF layer based on the command pattern is implemented to maintain the model data, then an existing modeling platform is refactored based on this base layer, and a large number of test codes are generated to ensure the reliability of the system. The experimental results show that the scalability and reliability of the system have been effectively improved. © 2022 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| No             |          | Cultural specificities of online dictionaries for English learners: Evidence from a user survey and a multimodal discourse analysis                                                                          | This study examines three popular e-dictionary platforms using a quantitative user survey coupled with a qualitative multimodal discourse analysis (MDA): Chinese Youdao, Cambridge English-Mandarin Chinese Dictionary (Cambridge), and the Free Dictionary (FD). The survey (N = 478) revealed that, despite its language flaws, Youdao was preferred by most Chinese EFL (English as a Foreign Language) learners mainly due to its search functionality and personalization. In contrast, English majors and postgraduates preferred Cambridge for its reliability and multimodal resources. FD ranked the lowest in popularity mainly for perceived inconvenience of searching and less accessibility of personalized functions. Multinomial logistic regressions and structural equation modelling showed that dictionary selection by users was contingent upon their perception of its features and their use strategies. Furthermore, MDA revealed how each dictionary contributed to the construction of a cultural identity. Youdao seemed to be a toolbox for personal use, with raw texts of varying quality, but with a clear and practical vision, in addition to customization options. Cambridge portrayed itself as a welcoming language community through appealing imagery, interactive options, and diverse navigational styles. FD was comparable to a dynamic and cluttered library, archiving large blocks of hyperlinked texts and word lists accompanied by musical animations. In brief, multimodal and cultural factors partially explained Chinese EFL learners' preferences for a specific dictionary, highlighting the importance of adaptation to the linguistic and cultural background of the user, including customization. A general cultural and semiotic framework is proposed to examine the representation of cultural identity in e-dictionaries. © 2023 The Author(s).

Model-Based-Conceptual-Design (MBCD) attempts to use best-practices of Model-Based-Systems-Engineering (MBSE) to gain the envisioned benefits of model connectivity. Using MBSE supporting tools can transform Conceptual-Design into a digital-engineered process but may impede creativity and innovation. Concurrently, the design domain offers specific methods and tools for innovative Conceptual-Design. In the current study, we explore an existing Conceptual-Design framework and offer MBSE interpretation and tools extensions needed for its digital implementation. Through such exploration we highlight MBCD specific insights and discuss modeling-innovation interrelations. The implementation was accomplished using a domain-specific enabling software package on top of a market-accepted UML/SysML platform, extending the language definitions, where appropriate. The framework guided extensions allow generation of innovative bottom-up alternatives, solution integration, and solutions’ comparison. The use of modeling is shown to offer clearer process definition, specific methods assistance, and alternative ranking—both manually and automatically. Consequently, MBCD is accomplished, which supports innovation, while being digitally connected to full-scale-development models and the organizational assets at large. Through integration into the orderly Systems-Engineering process, traceability is maintained, and repeated iterations are supported, where conceptual decisions may be revisited. Additionally, through the introduction of an assets’ catalog, cross-organizational knowledge sharing is accomplished. The paper presents samples of the extensions, using a simplified example of technology design for Future Firefighting. The value of incorporating Conceptual-Design specific methodology and tools is evaluated through feedback from multiple domain experts.

| No             |          | DepCap: A Smart Healthcare Framework for EEG Based Depression Detection Using Time-Frequency Response and Deep Neural Network                                                                                | A novel wearable consumer electronics device for detecting Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) has been developed using deep learning techniques for smart healthcare. Accurate identification of MDD through individual interviews or perceiving Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is challenging. This study presents the concept of a novel wearable smart cap named DepCap for real-time detection of depression using EEG signals. First, spectrogram images are generated from the EEG signals of depressed and healthy patients using Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) to extract valuable features. Then, these spectrogram images obtained from STFT are used as input to the classification model. A deep analysis is done using various neural networks consisting of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). RNNs are used to extract temporal data from the EEG, while CNNs are used to retrieve spatial information. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) are the two different kinds of RNNs evaluated in this work. The implemented combination models are (STFT+CNN), (STFT+CNN-LSTM) and (STFT+CNN-GRU). Four pre-trained models, Inception, AlexNet, VGG16, and ResNet50 are also implemented along with the combination models. The dataset for this work is a publicly accessible dataset with 33 major depressive disorders and 30 healthy subjects. The evaluation results show that the STFT+CNN-LSTM has much better performance in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision of 99.9%, 100%, 99.8%, and 99.4%, respectively, than other implemented models. The proposed wearable device DepCap is based on the STFT+CNN+LSTM model and is also integrated with the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) framework for real-time depression detection. © 2013 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| No             |          | Attention-Based Convolutional Recurrent Deep Neural Networks for the Prediction of Response to Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Major Depressive Disorder                                    | Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) is proposed as an effective treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD). However, because of the suboptimal treatment outcome of rTMS, the prediction of response to this technique is a crucial task. We developed a deep learning (DL) model to classify responders (R) and non-responders (NR). With this aim, we assessed the pre-Treatment EEG signal of 34 MDD patients and extracted effective connectivity (EC) among all electrodes in four frequency bands of EEG signal. Two-dimensional EC maps are put together to create a rich connectivity image and a sequence of these images is fed to the DL model. Then, the DL framework was constructed based on transfer learning (TL) models which are pre-Trained convolutional neural networks (CNN) named VGG16, Xception, and EfficientNetB0. Then, long short-Term memory (LSTM) cells are equipped with an attention mechanism added on top of TL models to fully exploit the spatiotemporal information of EEG signal. Using leave-one subject out cross validation (LOSO CV), Xception-BLSTM-Attention acquired the highest performance with 98.86% of accuracy and 97.73% of specificity. Fusion of these models as an ensemble model based on optimized majority voting gained 99.32% accuracy and 98.34% of specificity. Therefore, the ensemble of TL-LSTM-Attention models can predict accurately the treatment outcome. World Scientific Publishing Company. © 2023 World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte Ltd.

The plethora of various concerns being addressed in a single model can impede the ability of individual stakeholders to discern their aspects of relevance. Architectural views allow to spread the various concerns into multiple (smaller) models, each of which addresses a specific concern, thereby aiding architects to break down the complexity of the overall architecture. To enable that, the architectural language should be able to provide explicit separation of concerns, addressed by multiple and somehow separated language portions. For secure collaborative architecting, these portions should be equipped with access control mechanisms that ensure the integrity and confidentiality of the models.In this paper, we present our vision for the automated generation of portions of architectural (and more generically modeling) languages enhanced with access control mechanisms and co-evolution of the architectural portions in response to changes made to the base language. © 2023 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

To address this challenge, execution engines of model management programs need to become more efficient in their use of system resources. This paper presents an approach for partial loading of large models that reside in graph-database-backed model repositories. This approach leverages sophisticated static analysis of model management programs and auto-generation of graph (Cypher) queries to load only relevant model elements instead of naively loading the entire models into memory. Our experimental evaluation shows that our approach enables model management programs to process larger models, faster, and with a reduced memory footprint compared to the state of the art. © 2022 ACM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

LCDPs typically run on the cloud with zero-cost installation and often use graphical languages to describe the target applications. While building LCDPs manually is costly, the process can benefit from the automation that model-driven technologies offer. To this end, we propose Dandelion, a cloud-based graphical-language workbench specifically designed to create LCDPs. Dandelion supports the definition of the abstract and concrete syntax of graphical languages, resulting in tailored cloud-based modelling environments. To cater for industrial needs, the tool can be connected with heterogeneous modelling technologies - including proprietary formats or standards like EMF - and can handle large models via persistence in Elasticsearch and a model pagination mechanism. To facilitate modelling by citizen developers, it features sensemaking strategies to ease understanding (meta-)models via interactive graphics and diagrams; and flexible modelling support to relax the meta-model/model conformance relation, thus tolerating inconsistencies.

The field of Mispronunciation Detection and Diagnosis (MDD) is considered one of the applications of these frameworks and has recently benefited from the rapid innovation spawned in deep learning models and different acoustic, phonetic, and linguistic features. The various manner of combinations of different features and deep learning architectures for different MDD systems require huge amount of annotated textual data to be pretrained and hence achieved good performances. However, providing a large amount of annotated textual data for pre-training is a tedious and time-consuming operation. For this, a pre-trained acoustic model from unannotated data can be a good alternative. In this article, we present different MDD systems categorized according to the pre-training mode: pre-trained approaches without annotated text data and pre-trained approaches with annotated text data. Experimental results, advantages, disadvantages and additional improvements for each method explored for each category are presented and discussed. © 2023 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

While these languages enable the specification of concise transformations through task-specific constructs (rules/mappings, bindings), their use can pose scalability challenges when it comes to very large models. In this paper, we present an architecture for optimising the execution of model-to-model transformations written in such a language, by leveraging static analysis and automated program rewriting techniques. We demonstrate how static analysis and dependency information between rules can be used to reduce the size of the transformation trace and to optimise certain classes of transformations. Finally, we detail the performance benefits that can be delivered by this form of optimisation, through a series of benchmarks performed with an existing transformation language (Epsilon Transformation Language - ETL) and EMF-based models. Our experiments have shown considerable performance improvements compared to the existing ETL execution engine, without sacrificing any features of the language. © 2022 ACM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Declarative equation-based modeling languages, in turn, enable the creation of large-scale simulation-based DTs, as they relieve the analyst from creating the solution code. However, most industrial assets are cyber-physical systems, the cyber part being their digital controls. With the available technology, a precise representation of modulating and logic controls conflicts with DT simulation performance. The result is a barrier to using DTs for system-level optimization. We analyze the problem, propose a modeling paradigm to solve it, and suggest how to integrate that paradigm into equation-based language compilers. We support our proposal by presenting a Modelica/C++ library, which we release as free software, built according to the said paradigm. © 2005-2012 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Several activities in model-driven engineering (MDE), like model transformation testing, would require the availability of big sets of realistic models. However, the commu-nity has failed so far in producing large model repositories, and the lack of freely available industrial models has been raised as one of the most important problems in MDE. Consequently, MDE researchers have developed various tools and methods to generate models using different approaches, such as graph grammar, partitioning, and random generation. However, these tools rarely focus on producing new models, considering their realism. Contribution. In this work, we utilize generative deep learning, in particular, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), to present an approach for generating new structurally realistic models. Built atop the Eclipse Modeling Framework, the proposed tool can produce new artificial models from a metamodel and one big instance model as inputs. Graph-based metrics have been used to evaluate the approach. The preliminary statistical results illustrate that using GAN s can be promising for creating new realistic models. © 2023 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

This study aims to understand the evaluation types and methods applied by researchers when studying UX in modeling tools (modeling experience or MX) and the types of issues uncovered in these studies. We conducted a literature review using a snowballing approach to gather all studies of this topic. A total of 41 research papers were reviewed. Data extraction was performed based on research questions and a categorization of discussed issues was presented. Several gaps and future opportunities were identified and discussed, which include 1) utilizing interview method in research design; 2) distributing testing tasks based on user profiles; 3) involving UX experts in analysis; 4) scalability testing using large models; 5) assessing MX in areas other than just usability and utility; 6) considering collaborative modeling as an important factor contributing to MX; 7) considering both language issues and tool issues in UX evaluation of software modeling tools; 8) improving the taxonomy of MX challenges; 9) triangulating using multiple methods; and 10) developing and validating MX tool design heuristics. © 2013 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

We introduce a synthesis process based on metamodel matching, correspondence patterns between metamodels, and completeness and consistency analysis of matches. We describe how the limitations of metamodel matching can be addressed by combining matching with automated requirements analysis and model transformation by example (MTBE) techniques.We show that in practical examples a large percentage of required transformation functionality can usually be constructed automatically, thus potentially reducing development effort. We also evaluate the efficiency of synthesised transformations.Our novel contributions are:The concept of correspondence patterns between metamodels of a transformation.Requirements analysis of transformations using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML).Symbolic MTBE using "predictive specification"to infer transformations from examples.Transformation generation in multiple MT languages and in Java, from an abstract intermediate language. © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

By summarizing their respective advantages, we created a complete three-dimensional scene. To achieve basic functions such as vector data recording, three-dimensional browsing, and animation production, we used C# language and AutoCAD and Lumion computer visualization software for secondary development. Experimental results show that the joint modeling method proposed in this study integrates the advantages of 3DsMax and Sketch Up software and combines them with AutoCAD and Lumion computer visualization software, successfully avoiding the problem of format mismatch caused by multi-software modeling. Furthermore, this method shortens the modeling cycle and reduces the difficulty of scene modeling. Therefore, it provides a convenient solution for the rapid construction of large-scale three-dimensional scenes. © 2023 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Consequently, verification time dominates implementation time. The gold standard in hardware Design Verification (DV) is dynamic random testing, due to its scalability to large designs. However, given its undirected nature, this technique is inefficient. Instead of making incremental improvements to existing dynamic hardware verification approaches, we leverage the observation that existing software fuzzers already provide such a solution, and hence adapt them for hardware verification. Specifically, we translate RTL hardware to a software model and fuzz that model directly. The central challenge we address is how to mitigate the differences between the hardware and software execution models. This includes: 1) how to represent test cases, 2) what is the hardware equivalent of a crash, 3) what is an appropriate coverage metric, and 4) how to create a general-purpose fuzzing harness for hardware. To evaluate our approach, we design, implement, and open-source a Hardware Fuzzing Pipeline that enables fuzzing hardware at scale, using only open-source tools. Using our pipeline, we fuzz five IP blocks from Google's OpenTitan Root-of-Trust chip, four SiFive TileLink peripherals, three RISC-V CPUs, and an FFT accelerator. Our experiments reveal a two orders-of-magnitude reduction in run time to achieve similar Finite State Machine coverage over traditional dynamic verification schemes, and 26.70% better HDL line coverage than prior work. Moreover, with our bus-centric harness, we achieve over 83% HDL line coverage in four of the five OpenTitan IPs we study-without any initial seeds-and are able to detect all bugs (four synthetic from Hack@DAC and one real) implanted across all five OpenTitan IPs we study, with less than 10 hours of fuzzing. © USENIX Security Symposium, Security 2022.All rights reserved.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| No             |          | Automatic Speech Recognition Post-Processing for Readability: Task, Dataset and a Two-Stage Pre-Trained Approach                                                                                             | Nowadays Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems can accurately recognize which words are said. However, due to the disfluency, grammatical error, and other phenomena in spontaneous speech, the verbatim transcription of ASR impairs its readability, which is crucial for human comprehension and downstream tasks processing that need to understand the meaning and purpose of what is spoken. In this work, we formulate the ASR post-processing for readability (APR) as a sequence-to-sequence text generation problem that aims to transform the incorrect and noisy ASR output into readable text for humans and downstream tasks. We leverage the Metadata Extraction (MDE) corpus to construct a task-specific dataset for our study. To solve the problem of too little training data, we propose a novel data augmentation method that synthesizes large-scale training data from the grammatical error correction dataset. We propose a model based on the pre-trained language model to perform the APR task and train the model with a two-stage training strategy to better exploit the augmented data. On the constructed test set, our approach outperforms the best baseline system by a large margin of 17.53 on BLEU and 13.26 on readability-aware WER (RA-WER). The human evaluation also shows that our model can generate more human-readable transcripts than the baseline method. © 2013 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| No             |          | A Closer Look at Debiased Temporal Sentence Grounding in Videos: Dataset, Metric, and Approach                                                                                                               | Temporal Sentence Grounding in Videos (TSGV), which aims to ground a natural language sentence that indicates complex human activities in an untrimmed video, has drawn widespread attention over the past few years. However, recent studies have found that current benchmark datasets may have obvious moment annotation biases, enabling several simple baselines even without training to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. In this paper, we take a closer look at existing evaluation protocols for TSGV, and find that both the prevailing dataset splits and evaluation metrics are the devils that lead to untrustworthy benchmarking. Therefore, we propose to re-organize the two widely-used datasets, making the ground-truth moment distributions different in the training and test splits, i.e., out-of-distribution (OOD) test. Meanwhile, we introduce a new evaluation metric "dR@n,IoU=m"that discounts the basic recall scores especially with small IoU thresholds, so as to alleviate the inflating evaluation caused by biased datasets with a large proportion of long ground-truth moments. New benchmarking results indicate that our proposed evaluation protocols can better monitor the research progress in TSGV. Furthermore, we propose a novel causality-based Multi-branch Deconfounding Debiasing (MDD) framework for unbiased moment prediction. Specifically, we design a multi-branch deconfounder to eliminate the effects caused by multiple confounders with causal intervention. In order to help the model better align the semantics between sentence queries and video moments, we enhance the representations during feature encoding. Specifically, for textual information, the query is parsed into several verb-centered phrases to obtain a more fine-grained textual feature. For visual information, the positional information has been decomposed from the moment features to enhance the representations of moments with diverse locations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach can achieve competitive results among existing SOTA approaches and outperform the base model with great gains. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

However, extensive knowledge on CEP is required to be able to implement CEP applications. To alleviate this situation, in recent years, several works have proposed the use of Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) to facilitate the development of such CEP applications for domain experts. In this paper, we propose a systematic literature review of existing approaches, frameworks, systems and languages that integrate MDE with CEP, along with the application domains and maturity levels with which these proposals have been successfully adopted. Based on our findings, future research challenges in the CEP field are also discussed. © 2022, Journal of Object Technology.

To overcome or reduce this problem, reverse engineering has been increasingly used in safety-critical systems. This paper proposes C2AADL_Reverse, a model-driven reverse engineering approach for safety-critical software development and verification. C2AADL_Reverse takes multi-task C source code as input, and generates AADL (Architecture Analysis and Design Language) model of the legacy software systems. Compared with the existing works, this paper considers more reversed construction including AADL component structure, behavior, and multi-threaded run-time information. Moreover, two types of activities are proposed to ensure the correctness of C2AADL_Reverse. First, it is necessary to validate the reverse engineering process. Second, the generated AADL models should conform to desired critical properties. We propose the verification of the reverse-engineered AADL model by using UPPAAL to establish component-level properties and the Assume Guarantee REasoning Environment (AGREE) to perform compositional verification of the architecture. This combination of verification tools allows us to iteratively explore design and verification of detailed behavioral models, and to scale formal analysis to large models. In addition, the prototype tool and the evaluation of C2AADL_Reverse using a real-world aerospace case study are presented. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

It has a number of advantages, for instance the lacks of control flow allows computation to be carried out in parallel as well as in distributed machines. More recently the idea of dataflow graphs has also been brought into the design of various deep learning frameworks. They facilitate an easy and efficient implementation of automatic differentiation, which is the heart of modern deep learning paradigm. Many dataflow languages are ‘modal’ in the sense that the dataflow graph is ‘constructed’ in an ambient environment then ‘executed’ using special commands. Simulink, earlier Tensorflow, Lucid Synchrone (LS) or Self-adjusting computation (SAC) are examples of such languages. We are interested in modal dataflow languages in which the ambient environment is a fully fledged functional and imperative language. Such ambient languages make creating complex and large models easier, but they raise questions of language design, safety and efficiency. LS provides a way to define dataflow graphs through co-recursive equations of streams. In these cases the interesting issue is efficiency, particularly of memory utilisation. A semantically interesting question occurs in the case of languages which allow the explicit manipulation of the dataflow graph using imperative constructs. This is the case of early Tensorflow and imperative SAC. However the meta-programming style of TensorFlow in which special commands are used to construct imperatively a dataflow graph was considered awkward and error prone, and TensorFlow moved away from it. Constructing a dataflow graph imperatively can be convenient, but both Tensorflow and SAC are unsafe, in the sense that ‘illegal’ dataflow graphs can be constructed during the execution, which leads to unsafe behaviour. These problems can be avoided by a judicious language design. We present an idealised calculus for dataflow with both imperative and functional features using an abstract machine model based on Geometry of Interaction enhanced with rewriting features (‘Dynamic GoI’). Although the language is modal, with distinct executions for the PCF-like fragment and the DFG fragment, the syntax of the language is uniform. So the language lacks the “metaprogramming” feel of TensorFlow and other embedded DSL-like solutions. Concretely, any operator is used in the same way whether as a part of the host language or the DFG. This is akin to operator overloading, except that it is realised an a purely semantic way. Establishing a “semantic context”, defined by its history of execution, is as far as we know a novel approach which, as we shall see, will require a novel approach to semantics. We have also proved safety of the language and its in-principle efficiency. A prototype implementation of the calculus is also described, as a PPX extension of the OCaml programming language. © Steven W.T. Cheung, Dan R.

As classic database technology does not support arrays adequately, such data today are maintained mostly in silo solutions, with architectures that tend to erode and not keep up with the increasing requirements on performance and service quality. Array Database systems attempt to close this gap by providing declarative query support for flexible ad-hoc analytics on large n-D arrays, similar to what SQL offers on set-oriented data, XQuery on hierarchical data, and SPARQL and CIPHER on graph data. Today, Petascale Array Database installations exist, employing massive parallelism and distributed processing. Hence, questions arise about technology and standards available, usability, and overall maturity. Several papers have compared models and formalisms, and benchmarks have been undertaken as well, typically comparing two systems against each other. While each of these represent valuable research to the best of our knowledge there is no comprehensive survey combining model, query language, architecture, and practical usability, and performance aspects. The size of this comparison differentiates our study as well with 19 systems compared, four benchmarked to an extent and depth clearly exceeding previous papers in the field; for example, subsetting tests were designed in a way that systems cannot be tuned to specifically these queries. It is hoped that this gives a representative overview to all who want to immerse into the field as well as a clear guidance to those who need to choose the best suited datacube tool for their application. This article presents results of the Research Data Alliance (RDA) Array Database Assessment Working Group (ADA:WG), a subgroup of the Big Data Interest Group. It has elicited the state of the art in Array Databases, technically supported by IEEE GRSS and CODATA Germany, to answer the question: how can data scientists and engineers benefit from Array Database technology? As it turns out, Array Databases can offer significant advantages in terms of flexibility, functionality, extensibility, as well as performance and scalability—in total, the database approach of offering “datacubes” analysis-ready heralds a new level of service quality. Investigation shows that there is a lively ecosystem of technology with increasing uptake, and proven array analytics standards are in place. Consequently, such approaches have to be considered a serious option for datacube services in science, engineering and beyond. Tools, though, vary greatly in functionality and performance as it turns out. © 2021, The Author(s).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Such fully supervised data-driven approaches are annotation-intensive and often fail to consider the underlying mechanisms of visual attention. In contrast, in this paper, we introduce a model based on various cognitive theories of visual saliency, which learns visual attention patterns in a weakly supervised manner. Our approach incorporates insights from cognitive science as differentiable submodules, resulting in a unified, end-to-end trainable framework. Specifically, our model encapsulates the following important components motivated from biological vision. (a) As scene semantics are closely related to visually attentive regions, our model encodes discriminative spatial information for scene understanding through spatial visual semantics embedding. (b) To model the objectness factors in visual attention deployment, we incorporate object-level semantics embedding and object relation information. (c) Considering the 'winner-take-all' mechanism in visual stimuli processing, we model the competition mechanism among objects with softmax based neural attention. (d) Lastly, a conditional center prior is learned to mimic the spatial distribution bias of visual attention. Furthermore, we propose novel loss functions to utilize supervision cues from image-level semantics, saliency prior knowledge, and self-information compression. Experiments show that our method achieves promising results, and even outperforms many of its fully supervised counterparts. Overall, our weakly supervised saliency method makes an essential step towards reducing the annotation budget of current approaches, as well as providing a more comprehensive understanding of the visual attention mechanism.

Tailored high-level query languages are used to query such heterogeneous models, but typically this has a significant impact on performance. Our main aim is to propose optimization strategies that can help to query large models in various formats efficiently. In this paper, we present an approach based on compile-time static analysis and specific query optimizers/translators to improve the performance of complex queries over large-scale heterogeneous models. The proposed approach aims to bring efficiency in terms of query execution time and memory footprint, when compared to the naive query execution for low-code platforms. © 2020 ACM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Creating such software mainly amounts to implementing complex behaviors known as missions. Recognizing this need, a large number of domain-specific specification languages has been proposed. These, in addition to traditional logical languages, allow the use of formally specified missions for synthesis, verification, simulation or guiding implementation. For instance, the logical language LTL is commonly used by experts to specify missions as an input for planners, which synthesize a robot's required behavior. Unfortunately, domain-specific languages are usually tied to specific robot models, while logical languages such as LTL are difficult to use by non-experts. We present a catalog of 22 mission specification patterns for mobile robots, together with tooling for instantiating, composing, and compiling the patterns to create mission specifications. The patterns provide solutions for recurrent specification problems; each pattern details the usage intent, known uses, relationships to other patterns, and - most importantly - a template mission specification in temporal logic. Our tooling produces specifications expressed in the temporal logics LTL and CTL to be used by planners, simulators or model checkers. The patterns originate from 245 mission requirements extracted from the robotics literature, and they are evaluated upon a total of 441 real-world mission requirements and 1251 mission specifications. Five of these reflect scenarios defined with two well-known industrial partners developing human-size robots. We further validate our patterns' correctness with simulators and two different types of real robots. © 1976-2012 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

The multitude of packages and the different interfaces or adapters is also the reason why ROS projects often tend to become confusing. Concepts of model-driven software development using a domain-specific modeling language could counteract this and at the same time speed up the development process of such projects. This is investigated in this paper by transferring the core concepts from ROS 2 into a graphical programming interface. Elements of established graphical programming tools are compared and approaches from modeling languages such as UML are used to create a novel approach for graphical development of ROS projects. The resulting interface is evaluated through the development of a project built on ROS, and the approach shows promise towards facilitating work with the Robot Operating System. © 2021 ICROS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| No             |          | Weakly-supervised large-scale image modeling for sport scenes and its applications                                                                                                                           | Image modeling towards sport scenes plays an important role in sport image classification and analysis. Traditional algorithms for sport image modeling required carefully hand-crafted features, which cannot be popularized in practical application, especially with the emergence of massive-scale data. Weakly-supervised learning algorithms have shown effectiveness in modeling data with image-level labels. Thus, in this paper, we propose a weakly-supervised learning based method for sport image modeling without utilizing bounding box annotations, which can be used for various sport image applications. More specifically, we first collect large-scale sport images from existing datasets and Internet, and we annotate them at image-level labels. Subsequently, we leverage region proposal generation algorithm to select discriminative regions that can effectively represent the category of images. Each region is fed into a pre-trained CNN architecture to extract deep representation. Afterwards, we design an improved multiple discriminant analysis (MDA) algorithm to project these datapoints to a subspace that can more easily to distinguish different sport categories. Comprehensive experiments have shown the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

In addition, there are risks of low communication efficiency and quality problems. Model-based system engineering (MBSE) is an effective solution to these problems. This paper adopts the MBSE method, based on the system modeling language (SysML), to analyze the functional requirements and architecture design of the satellite EPS, and at the same time to model and design the energy balance analysis. This will not only achieve efficient information expression and data transmission, but also provide a fundamental guarantee for the thoroughness of the EPS development process in satellite. This new EPS design mode has greatly improved the communication and efficiency of the design. © 2022 SPIE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

The ever-increasing design difficulty makes many factors need to be considered when designing. SystemC is a language that describes the system from a high level of abstraction. The description level of SystemC ranges from RTL to system architecture, including software and hardware, which makes it more widely used. At the same time, SystemC runs faster than traditional hardware description languages. This paper designs a lightweight system based on SystemC. It contains a bus module, a serial interface (UART) module, a processor module, an arbiter module, a memory module, and a driver module of the test system. The system sends input data by the drive module, and the arbiter module generates two selection signals. The data is processed in the processor module, and then enters the bus. The bus is processed according to the signal of the arbiter module, and the selected data enters the serial port.

Model-driven and view-based technologies have made it easier to define domain-specific languages and transformations. Nevertheless, using several languages leads to fragmentation of information, to redundancies in the system description, and eventually to inconsistencies. Inconsistencies have negative impacts on the system's quality and are costly to fix. Often, there is no support for consistency management across multiple languages. Using a single language is no practicable solution either, as it is overly complex to define, use, and evolve such a language. View-based development is a suitable approach to deal with complex systems, and is widely used in other engineering disciplines. Still, we need to cope with the problems of fragmentation and consistency. In this paper, we present the VITRUVIUS approach for consistency in view-based modeling. We describe the approach by formalizing the notion of consistency, presenting languages for consistency preservation, and defining a model-driven development process. Furthermore, we show how existing models can be integrated. We have evaluated our approach at two case studies from component-based and embedded automotive software development, using our prototypical implementation based on the Eclipse Modeling Framework. © 2020 The Authors                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

As technology advances, expectations of a smooth, flawless system operation grow. Model‐based systems engineering, an approach based on conceptual models, copes with this chal-lenge. Models help construct formal system representations, visualize them, understand the design, simulate the system, and discover design flaws early on. Modeling tools can benefit tremendously from querying capabilities that enable gaining deep insights into system aspects that direct model observations do not reveal. Querying mechanisms can unveil and explain cause‐and‐effect phenom-ena, identify central components, and estimate impacts or risks associated with changes. Being con-nected networks of system elements, models can be effectively represented as graphs, to which queries are applied. Capitalizing on established graph‐theoretic algorithms to solve a large variety of problems can elevate the modeling experience to new levels. To utilize this rich set of capabilities, one must convert the model into a graph and store it in a graph database with no significant loss of information. Applying the appropriate algorithms and translating the query response back to the original intelligible and meaningful diagrammatic and textual model representation is most valua-ble. We present and demonstrate a querying approach of converting Object‐Process Methodology (OPM) ISO 19450 models into graphs, storing them in a Neo4J graph database, and performing queries that answer complex questions on various system aspects, providing key insights into the modeled system or phenomenon and helping to improve the system design. © 2021 by the authors.

| No             |          | Thirteen years of SysML: a systematic mapping study                                                                                                                                                          | The OMG standard Systems Modeling Language (SysML) has been on the market for about thirteen years. This standard is an extended subset of UML providing a graphical modeling language for designing complex systems by considering software as well as hardware parts. Over the period of thirteen years, many publications have covered various aspects of SysML in different research fields. The aim of this paper is to conduct a systematic mapping study about SysML to identify the different categories of papers, (i) to get an overview of existing research topics and groups, (ii) to identify whether there are any publication trends, and (iii) to uncover possible missing links. We followed the guidelines for conducting a systematic mapping study by Petersen et al. (Inf Softw Technol 64:1–18, 2015) to analyze SysML publications from 2005 to 2017. Our analysis revealed the following main findings: (i) there is a growing scientific interest in SysML in the last years particularly in the research field of Software Engineering, (ii) SysML is mostly used in the design or validation phase, rather than in the implementation phase, (iii) the most commonly used diagram types are the SysML-specific requirement diagram, parametric diagram, and block diagram, together with the activity diagram and state machine diagram known from UML, (iv) SysML is a specific UML profile mostly used in systems engineering; however, the language has to be customized to accommodate domain-specific aspects, (v) related to collaborations for SysML research over the world, there are more individual research groups than large international networks. This study provides a solid basis for classifying existing approaches for SysML. Researchers can use our results (i) for identifying open research issues, (ii) for a better understanding of the state of the art, and (iii) as a reference for finding specific approaches about SysML. © 2019, The Author(s).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Therefore, developing IoT-based systems has been found to be a complex process. As a consequence, the development of these systems becomes more error-prone, time-consuming and costly. ESP (ESP8266 and ESP32) is one of the preferred micro-controllers for education, industrial projects, and prototyping. Arduino, a well-known firmware, is used in ESP which makes it easy-to-use. However, learning the device-specific configurations, using network features, and implementing IoT applications for ESP on the Arduino platform are still burdensome and time-consuming tasks. Raising the abstraction level can help to decrease the complexity and address this problem. To this end, in this paper, a model-driven approach is proposed for the development of Arduino-based programmable ESP micro-controllers. First, a meta-model is designed for the Arduino-based ESP micro-controllers. Based on this meta-model, a Domain-specific Language (DSL) is developed to graphically represent the domain models. To gain more functionality for the language, domain rules are defined as constraints. Also, partial system codes are automatically generated from the instance models. In this way, the development of IoT systems based on ESP modules is supported by code synthesis which increases the performance and reduces the number of errors. Finally, a motion-sensitive thief detector and a servo-motor based room temperature control system are implemented to evaluate the proposed DSL. © 2021 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

With new digital-enabled mass media, the communication process is centered around the user, while multimedia content is the new identity of news. Thus, the media landscape has shifted from mass media to personalized social media. While this progress brings advantages, it also carries the risk of being detrimental to society through the emergence of misinformation (false or inaccurate information) and disinformation (intentionally spreading misinformation) in the form of fake news. Fake news is a tool used to manipulate public opinion on particular topics, distort public perceptions, and generate social unrest while lacking the rigor of traditional journalism. Driven by this current and real-world problem, in this paper, we train multiple Deep Learning architectures for multi-class classification and compare their performance in detecting the veracity of the news articles. To achieve accurate models in detecting misinformation, we employ a large dataset containing 100 000 news articles labeled with ten classes (one with real news and the rest with different types of fake news). We use two preprocessing techniques, i.e., one simple and another very aggressive, to clean the dataset. We also employ three word embeddings that preserve the word context, i.e., Word2Vec, FastText, and GloVe, pre-trained and trained on our dataset to vectorize the preprocessed dataset. For the misinformation task, we train a Logistic Regression as a baseline and compare its results with the performance of ten Deep Learning architectures. We obtain the best results using a Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network based architecture. The experimental results show that the models are highly dependable on text preprocessing and the word embedding employed. © 2021 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

To mitigate large-scale annotations on the target domain, domain adaptation (DA) provides an alternate solution by learning a transferable model from other labeled source domains. Existing multi-source domain adaptation (MDA) methods either fail to extract some discriminative features in the target domain that are related to sentiment, neglect the correlations of different sources and the distribution difference among different sub-domains even in the same source, or cannot reflect the varying optimal weighting during different training stages. In this paper, we propose a novel instance-level MDA framework, named curriculum cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (C-CycleGAN), to address the above issues. Specifically, C-CycleGAN consists of three components: (1) pre-trained text encoder which encodes textual input from different domains into a continuous representation space, (2) intermediate domain generator with curriculum instance-level adaptation which bridges the gap across source and target domains, and (3) task classifier trained on the intermediate domain for final sentiment classification. C-CycleGAN transfers source samples at instance-level to an intermediate domain that is closer to the target domain with sentiment semantics preserved and without losing discriminative features. Further, our dynamic instance-level weighting mechanisms can assign the optimal weights to different source samples in each training stage. We conduct extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and achieve substantial gains over state-of-the-art DA approaches.

This study introduces another application of software engineering tools, conceptual modeling, which can be applied to other fields of research. One way to strengthen the relationship between software engineering and other fields is to develop a good way to perform conceptual modeling that is capable of addressing the peculiarities of these fields of study. This study concentrates on humanities and social sciences, which are usually considered “softer” and further away from abstractions and (abstract) machines. Specifically, we focus on conceptual modeling as a software engineering tool (e.g., UML) in the area of stories and movie scripts. Researchers in the humanities and social sciences might not use the same degree of formalization that engineers do, but they still find conceptual modeling useful. Current modeling techniques (e.g., UML) fail in this task because they are geared toward the creation of software systems. Similar Conceptual Modeling Language (e.g., ConML) has been proposed with the humanities and social sciences in mind and, as claimed, can be used to model “anything.” This study is a venture in this direction, where a software modeling technique, Thinging Machine (TM), is applied to movie scripts and stories. The paper presents a novel approach to developing diagrammatic static/dynamic models of movie scripts and stories. The TM model diagram serves as a neutral and independent representation for narrative discourse and can be used as a communication instrument among participants. It is based on the notion of thing/machine (or thimac). Things and events are defined as what can be created, released, transferred, received, accepted and processed. Machines are what create, process, release, transfer and receive things. The examples presented include examples from Propp’s model of fairytales; the railway children and an actual movie script seem to point to the viability of the approach. © 2020 Sabah Al-Fedaghi.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

In the context of railway systems engineering, system verification is of major importance as software failures can cause serious damage. At DB Netz AG, a railway infrastructure manager that operates large parts of the German railway system, the challenge of enabling both high-level system modelling and formal system verification is addressed by employing SysML, a widespread systems modelling language, and Event-B, a formal systems modelling language particularly suited for automated system verification. In the currently applied completely manual development process, engineers (i) create models using SysML, (ii) translate relevant parts of these models to Event-B for verification, (iii) possibly improve the Event-B models based on verification results, and finally (iv) reflect these improvements in the original SysML models. This process is both tedious and error-prone, clearly indicating a need for an increase in the level of automation. In this paper, we argue that steps (ii) and (iv) can be viewed as a coupled forward transformation and a backward synchronisation, respectively, as the SysML models cannot be completely reconstructed from their Event-B counterparts. Exploiting this observation, we demonstrate that steps (ii) and (iv) can be suitably automated using a bidirectional transformation (bx) language. With Triple Graph Grammars (TGGs) as a rule-based bx language, we establish a tool chain connecting the modelling tools used at DB Netz AG for SysML and Event-B. We show the feasibility of our automation solution by solving three representative case studies provided by DB Netz AG. Based on these case studies, we conduct a qualitative evaluation via semi-structured interviews with domain experts. © 2021.

Since a failure of these systems could lead to unacceptable consequences, it is imperative to guarantee high safety standards. In practice, as a way to handle their increasing complexity, these systems are often modelled as hierarchical systems. To date, a good deal of work has focused on the definition and analysis of hierarchical modelling languages and on their integration within model-driven development frameworks. Less work, however, has been directed towards formalisms to effectively express, in a precise and rigorous way, relevant behavioural properties of such systems (e.g.: safety requirements). In this work, we propose a novel extension of classic Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) called Hierarchical Linear Temporal Logic (HLTL), designed to express, in a natural yet rigorous way, behavioural properties of hierarhical systems. The formalism we propose does not commit to any specific modelling language, and can be used to predicate over a large variety of hierarchical systems. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Depending on a chosen application scenario, a model generator has to fulfill different requirements: As a modeling language is usually defined by a meta-model, all generated models are expected to conform to their meta-models. For performance tests of model-driven engineering techniques, the efficient generation of large models should be supported. When generating several models, the resulting set of models should show some diversity. Interactive model generation may help in producing relevant models. In this paper, we present a rule-based, configurable approach to automate model generation which addresses the stated requirements. Our model generator produces valid instance models of meta-models with multiplicities conforming to the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF). An evaluation of the model generator shows that large EMF models (with up to half a million elements) can be produced. Since the model generation is rule-based, it can be configured beforehand or during the generation process to produce sets of models that are diverse to a certain extent. © The Author(s) 2020.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

They are well-established for the model-driven engineering (MDE) of complex software systems and are supported by numerous commercial and academic tools, such as Simulink, LabVIEW or Ptolemy. In MDE, engineers concentrate on constructing and simulating such models, before application code (or at least a large fraction thereof) is synthesized automatically. However, a significant fraction of today’s legacy system has been coded directly, often using the C language. High-level models that give a quick, accurate overview of how components interact are often out of date or do not exist. This makes it challenging to maintain or extend legacy software, in particular for new team members. To address this problem, we here propose to reverse the classic synthesis path of MDE and to synthesize actor-based dataflow models automatically from source code. Here functions in the code get synthesized into nodes that represent actors manipulating data. Second, we propose to harness the modeling-pragmatic approach, which considers visual models not as static artefacts, but allows interactive, flexible views that also link back to textual descriptions. Thus we propose to synthesize actor models that can vary in level of detail and that allow navigation in the source code. To validate and evaluate our proposals, we implemented these concepts for C analysis in the open source, Eclipse-based KIELER project and conducted a small survey. © 2021, The Author(s).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

This is thanks to the creation and management of a common platform dedicated to develop a family of products. These latters can be a family of mobile phones, a family of different brake systems variants for automative needs, etc. Recently, more and more large-scale companies start to implement SSPL engineering in their domains by adopting Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE). Systems Product Line (PL) engineering is much broader than software PL engineering. Therefore, various aspects of variability (e.g. functional and quality attributes variabilities) have to be considered in MBSE. However, variability integrated in MBSE is still limited to functional variability. This paper contributes to enhance the SSPL modelling based on SysML by extending the SysML language. The principle aim is to include various aspects of variability. In fact, a holistic variability model is proposed to define the SysML extensions by means of the UML profiling mechanism. This permits to express variability constructs in different SysML modelling artifacts. We also present an application example namely the brake systems family extracted from Splot repository. We in fact, show how our SysML extensions are concretely used. © 2021, EasyChair.

Each language construct usually comes with its own abstract and concrete syntax, its semantics, and even its complete language dialect and tool support. Nowadays, there is a consensus in the Software Product Line community about a need for defining a common variability modeling language. But the fact of the matter is that it is very complex to achieve a good compromise between how expressive the language should be and the effort of developing practical tools for a language with all possible language constructs. In this paper, we propose an extensible model-driven engineering approach for defining the abstract syntax of feature modeling language constructs that could be tailored to different needs and domains. We formalize our approach as a set of modular and reusable metamodels that allows practitioners to decide which subset of language constructs to use through: (1) generating a new variability language; and (2) managing feature models with different level of expressiveness. We provide an instantiation and implementation of our approach. © 2020 ACM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Meanwhile, the manual construction of a query-focused summarization corpus is costly and time-consuming. In this paper, we use Wikipedia to automatically collect a large query-focused summarization dataset (named WikiRef) of more than 280,000 examples, which can serve as a means of data augmentation. We also develop a BERT-based query-focused summarization model (Q-BERT) to extract sentences from the documents as summaries. To better adapt a huge model containing millions of parameters to tiny benchmarks, we identify and fine-tune only a sparse subnetwork, which corresponds to a small fraction of the whole model parameters. Experimental results on three DUC benchmarks show that the model pre-trained on WikiRef has already achieved reasonable performance. After fine-tuning on the specific benchmark datasets, the model with data augmentation outperforms strong comparison systems. Moreover, both our proposed Q-BERT model and subnetwork fine-tuning further improve the model performance. © 2014 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Usually, text is also coded using appropriate terminologies and classifications. The act of coding is time consuming and prone to mistakes. Consequently, there is increasing demand for clinical text mining tools to help coding. In last few years Natural Language Processing (NLP) models has been shown to be effective in sentence-level tasks. Taking advantage from the transfer learning capabilities of those models, a number of biomedicine and health specific models have been also developed. However, also biomedical models can be seen as too general for some specific area like diagnostic expressions. In this paper, we describe a BERT model specialized on tasks related to diagnoses and health conditions. To obtain a disease-related language model, we created a pre-training corpora starting from ICD-11 entities, and enriched them with documents selected by querying PubMed and Wikipedia with entity names. Fine-tuning has been carried out towards three downstream tasks on two different datasets. Results show that our model, besides being trained on a much smaller corpora than state-of-the-art algorithms, leads to comparable or higher accuracy scores on all the considered tasks, in particular 97.53% accuracy on death certificate coding, and 81.32% on clinical document coding, which are both slightly higher than other models. To summarize the practical implications of our work, we pre-trained and fine-tuned a domain specific BERT model on a small corpora, with comparable or better performance than state-of-the-art models. This approach may also simplify the development of models for languages different from English, due to the minor quantity of data needed for training. © 2013 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

This can automatically transform models to other paradigms and programming languages. If a model has bugs, then MDE can transfer these to a new code. The class model is a key component of UML that is used in analysis and design. Without a formal foundation, UML can create only graphical diagrams, making it impossible to verify properties such as satisfiability, consistency and consequences. Different techniques have been used to verify UML class models, but these do not support some important components. This paper transforms and verifies unsupported components such as XOR association constraints and dependency relationships of a UML class model through ontol-ogy. We use various UML class models to validate the proposed ontology-based method, easy and efficient transformation and verification of unsupported elements. The results show this approach can verify large and complex models. © 2021, Tech Science Press.

These systems deal with a wide number of business processes; thus, the modeling and validation of processes becomes a challenging task. This entails dealing with issues such as the precedence between tasks and activities within a process, as well as resources, roles and enterprise assets involved. Moreover, undetected mistakes in this phase will be propagated to the system design phase and consequently will have a negative effect in the final system quality. On the other hand, the scientific literature advocates the suitability of formal models to address some issues during the process modeling. However, the adoption of formal models leads to new problems because formal languages are difficult to understand and process stakeholders usually lack of knowledge about them. In that direction, the Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) paradigm includes specifications that may alleviate some difficulties in the adoption of formal languages. Hence, in this paper we introduce an approach which combines MDA-specifications and ontologies to support process modeling. These technologies have great acceptance between both software researchers and developers. The use of ontologies permits to semantically validate the models. Furthermore, the application of MDA-guidelines could facilitate the integration of BPMN, a graphical notation for describing business process models widely accepted among business analysts, with a formal language to automate the analysis of business process models. © 2021 The Authors.

These missions are aided by data from multiple sensors like Electro Optic-Infrared (EO/IR) cameras, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), etc. Recent studies of classifying SAR images have been accomplished using supervised deep learning techniques to enhance the performance of classification. In this paper, we use transfer learning on VGG-16 architecture pre-trained on ImageNet dataset. The VGG-16 architecture is extended using a 2-step modular approach for the data classes in MASATI-V2 binary and MSTAR-SAR multiclass datasets. The model is then trained by suitable tuning of hyperparameters, and we report accuracies of 100% for binary classification and 99.18% for SAR multiclass classification. This approach reduces the overfitting in case of smaller dataset volume that is typical in SAR imagery in maritime domain, while reducing the time taken for training and deployment of the model. © 2021 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

One area identified is a lack of proper requirement scoping, which is prohibitively complex when tracing architectures for large systems. MBSE was developed to address these issues and provide a common framework to rapidly represent, convey, and synchronize information. This research explores the maturity of NLP and ML methodology needed to automatically generate and trace requirements in MBSE models, thus providing the tools to rapidly generate models from requirement documents and reducing the risk of program cancellation due to requirement scoping problems. © 2022 SPIE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

In the context of model-driven engineering, such behaviors are usually defined using executable domain-specific modeling languages (xDSML). Many V&V techniques rely on execution traces to represent and analyze the behavior of executable models. Traces, however, tend to be overwhelmingly large, hindering effective and efficient analysis of their content. While there exist several trace metamodels to represent execution traces, most of them suffer from scalability problems. In this paper, we present a generic compact trace representation format called generic compact trace metamodel (CTM) that enables the construction and manipulation of compact execution traces of executable models. CTM is generic in the sense that it supports a wide range of xDSMLs. We evaluate CTM on traces obtained from real-world fUML models. Compared to existing trace metamodels, the results show a significant reduction in memory and disk consumption. Moreover, CTM offers a common structure with the aim to facilitate interoperability between existing trace analysis tools. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

Based on this background, this paper studies the discrete dynamic modeling technology in the big data complex system. By analyzing the current situation of the English language, this paper studies the dynamic path of the development of English functional grammar. Different from traditional modeling algorithms, dynamic modeling of complex systems can accurately process the relevant data provided by big data. This paper discusses the influence of functional grammar on English listening teaching through dynamic modeling and predictive analysis. This study reduces the error rate of the English prediction model and determines that the change of English achievement is closely related to functional grammar. The results show that the dynamic modeling of complex systems can promote the rapid development of functional grammar in English teaching and provide an effective basis for grammar research. At the same time, the dynamic prediction model based on complex system modeling can accurately predict the actual effect of English grammatical functions on improving English proficiency. © 2022 Yuzheng Gao and Hongli Chen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

IEC 61850 and IEC 61499 are two industrial standards that can address the challenges introduced by the smart grid on the substation automation level. Development of smart grid automation software is a very time-consuming process due to the need to address many requirements and a high degree of customization in every new substation, which limits the adoption of such smart grid technologies in digital substations. This article aims at addressing this limitation by applying a semiformal boilerplates (BPs) model of functional requirements originally presented in informal natural language. The BPs are then modeled formally in an ontology for model-driven engineering (MDE) model transformation. The contribution of this article is the development of the semiformal and formal BP representation in the form of ontology to formulate smart grid requirements and demonstrating how functional requirements can be translated to IEC 61499 control codes using MDE to autogenerate an IEC 61499 protection and control system with structure and control flow. The MDE framework augmented with the requirement models is illustrated in a case study from the International Council on Large Electric Systems representing different stages of modeling in the proposed framework. © 2005-2012 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| No             |          | Depression Recognition Method Based on Regional Homogeneity Features from Emotional Response fMRI Using Deep Convolutional Neural Network                                                                    | The research of deep convolutions neural network (DNN) in the depression recognition has become a popular topic. In this paper, we propose a method for depression recognition based on the regional homogeneity (ReHo) in emotional task state functional magnetic resonance imaging (task-fMRI) using DNN. First, the task-fMRI is extracted by processing the fMRI of emotional stimulation tasks. And the task-fMRI with ReHo (ReHo-task-fMRI) is calculated based on task-fMRI. And then, convolutional networks of DNN (such as VGG16, etc.) pre-trained on ImageNet are used to automatically complete extracting the classification features from ReHo-task-fMRI. Finally, the Kernel Extreme Learning Machine (KELM) was used to classify the depression. The results of test set showing that for depression recognition, the sensitivity and specificity of ReHo-task-fMRI were 87.46% and 85.35%, however that of task-fMRI were only 67.69% and 55.44%. This study suggest that compared with emotional task-fMRI, ReHo-task-fMRI can better represent the characteristics of brain dysfunction for patients with depression. © 2021 ACM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| No             |          | Improving Mispronunciation Detection with Wav2vec2-based Momentum Pseudo-Labeling for Accentedness and Intelligibility Assessment                                                                            | Current leading mispronunciation detection and diagnosis (MDD) systems achieve promising performance via end-to-end phoneme recognition. One challenge of such end-to-end solutions is the scarcity of human-annotated phonemes on natural L2 speech. In this work, we leverage unlabeled L2 speech via a pseudo-labeling (PL) procedure and extend the fine-tuning approach based on pre-trained self-supervised learning (SSL) models. Specifically, we use Wav2vec 2.0 as our SSL model, and fine-tune it using original labeled L2 speech samples plus the created pseudo-labeled L2 speech samples. Our pseudo labels are dynamic and are produced by an ensemble of the online model on-the-fly, which ensures that our model is robust to pseudo label noise. We show that fine-tuning with pseudo labels achieves a 5.35% phoneme error rate reduction and 2.48% MDD F1 score improvement over a labeled-samples-only fine-tuning baseline. The proposed PL method is also shown to outperform conventional offline PL methods. Compared to the state-of-the-art MDD systems, our MDD solution produces a more accurate and consistent phonetic error diagnosis. In addition, we conduct an open test on a separate UTD-4Accents dataset, where our system recognition outputs show a strong correlation with human perception, based on accentedness and intelligibility.

Automated requirements traceability faces the low precision challenge due to a large number of false positives being returned and mingled with the true links. To overcome this challenge, we present a mutation-driven method built on the novel idea of proactively creating many seemingly correct tracing targets (i.e., mutants of a state machine diagram), and then exploiting model checking within process mining to automatically verify whether the safety requirement's properties hold in the mutants. A mutant is killed if its model checking fails; otherwise, it is survived. We leverage the underlying killed-survived distinction, and develop a correlation analysis procedure to identify the traceability links. Experimental evaluation results on two automotive systems with 27 safety requirements show considerable precision improvements compared with the state-of-the-art. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Digital industrialization puts forward higher requirements for the use of big data than simple tasks, such as generating reports. MWorks is a multidomain unified modeling and simulation platform based on the Modelica language. In this study, MWorks is used to realize the modeling of multidomain systems, including electrical, thermal, mechanical, fluid, and heat transfer, in power plants.

This strategy helps to achieve real-time performance; however, the accuracy is significantly compromised in comparison to non-real-time methods. In this paper, we introduce two key modules aimed to design a high-performance decoder for real-time semantic segmentation, which also reduces the accuracy gap between real-time and non-real-time networks. The first module, Dilated Asymmetric Pyramidal Fusion (DAPF), is designed to increase the receptive field on the top of the last stage of the encoder, obtaining richer contextual features. The second module, Multi-resolution Dilated Asymmetric (MDA) module, fuses and refines detail and contextual information from multi-scale feature maps coming from early and deeper stages of the network. Both modules are designed to keep a low computational complexity by using asymmetric convolutions. With these modules, we propose a network entitled \`\`FASSD-Net,'' which is based on a light-weight CNN backbone. Running on a single Nvidia GTX 1080Ti, our model reaches 77.5&#x0025; and 69.3&#x0025; of mIoU, at 41 and 80 FPS on the Cityscapes and CamVid datasets, respectively. We present an extensive analysis of the accuracy-speed tradeoffs of three FASSD-Net variations on different embedded systems, demonstrating that a light version of our network can run on the low-power consumption Jetson Xavier NX, at 32 FPS reaching 74&#x0025; of mIoU with full resolution (1024x 2048).

This situation forces organizations to migrate their applications to modern frameworks regularly so they do not become obsolete. There has been research in the past on automatic GUI migration. However, and concurrently, large organisations’ applications use many different technologies. For example, the IT company with which we are working, Berger-Levrault, wishes to migrate applications written in generic programming language (Java/GWT), proprietary “4th generation” languages (VisualBasic 6, PowerBuilder), or markup languages (Silverlight). Furthermore, one must expect that in a few years time, new frameworks will appear and new migrations will be required. Thus, there is a need for a language-agnostic migration approach allowing one to migrate various legacy GUI to the latest technologies. None of the existing solutions allow to deal with such a variety of GUI framework. They also typically focus on a subpart of the migration (i.e. how to extract a specific GUI framework) ignoring the re-engineering/forward-engineering part of the migration (which is straightforward for a single technology). This makes it difficult to adapt these solutions to other GUI frameworks. We propose an approach to migrate the GUI part of applications. It is based on meta-models to represent the visual element structure and layout. We detail how to create both the GUI extractors and generators, with guidelines to support new markup and programming languages. We evaluate our approach by implementing three extractors and generators for web-based or desktop-based user interfaces defined with generic programming languages (Java, Pharo, TypeScript) or markup languages (XML, HTML). We comment case studies on five applications, opened and closed source, of different sizes. The implementations of our generic approach detect 99% of the widgets and identify (i.e. determine the type of the widget) 97% of them. We give examples of the migrated GUIs, both successful and not. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

While simple domain-specific graphical languages and libraries can empower a variety of users to create application behaviors and logic, using these languages to produce and maintain a set of heterogeneous client applications is a challenge. Primarily because each client typically requires the developers to both understand and embed the domain-specific logic. This is because application logic must be encoded to some extent in both the server and client sides. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach, which allows the specification of application logic to reside solely on the cloud. We have built a system where reusable application components can be assembled on the cloud in different logical chains and the client is largely decoupled from this logic and is solely concerned with how data is displayed and gathered from users of the application. In this way, the chaining of requests and responses is done by the cloud and the client side has no knowledge of the application logic. This means that the experts in the domain can build these modular cloud components, arrange them in various logical chains, generate a simple user interface to test the application, and later leave it to client-side developers to customize the presentation and gathering of data types to and from the user. An additional effect of our approach is that the client side developer is able to immediately see any changes they make, while executing the logic residing on the cloud. This further allows more novice programmers to perform these customizations, as they do not need to 'get the full application working' and are able to see the results of their code as they go, thereby lowering the obstacles to businesses and individuals to produce and maintain applications. Furthermore, this decoupling enables the quick generation and customization of a variety of application clients, ranging from web to mobile devices and personal assistants, while customizing one or more as needed. Creating new computer applications, distributing them to users, and maintaining them, is complex and time-consuming. Building even a simple application requires years of study. Furthermore, given the number of devices we have today (from smartphones to voice assistants), the task is further complicated and difficult even for experienced programmers. The world is undergoing a digital transformation, and computer applications are now part of our everyday existence and building them is a requirement for many organizations and businesses. How-ever, only companies and individuals with large budgets and skills can build these applications, a consequence of which is an increased digital gap between those with means and those without. We see a clear need to lower the barriers to building these applications so a more diverse set of voices are able to participate and shape our digital futures, as underrepresented groups are often left out of designing and building these platforms. Previous researchers have proposed approaches where applications can be easily specified by people without (or with few) technical skills. However, handling different device platforms and maintenance/distribution were neglected in these efforts. In this paper we propose an approach where the program is executed on the cloud, while the client only needs to display and gather data from users. A result of our approach is that generic front-end applications adapt to any changes to the program being executed on the cloud. Our programs work with end-user apps on any device, the application that the user sees automatically adapts to any changes. © 2022 IEEE. |

Nowadays, a significant number of them operate using open source software, such as Robot Operating System (ROS) and the de facto standard MAVLink communication protocol, as they are free and many of them are reusable enough that they can be deployed in various different vehicles. Although these technologies offer a wide variety of resources, using them requires a reasonable background of programming and system engineering. Often, this is not achievable by common drone end-users in the short-term, as they would need to acquire a considerably large amount of know-how before working on specific domains. However, a graphical Domain Specific Modelling Language (DSML) might provide a shortcut to design drone missions using already known concepts to the end-users (or, at least, ones easier to learn). Pursuing this shortcut, RoBMEX is presented as a top-down methodology based on a set of domain specific languages able to enhance the autonomy of ROS-based systems, by allowing the creation of missions graphically, and then generating automatically executable source codes conforming to the designed missions. © 2021                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Many studies have proposed sophisticated models to detect intrusions from a large amount of data, yet they ignored the fact that poor data quality has a direct impact on the performance of intrusion detection systems. Examples of poor data quality include mislabeled, inaccurate, incomprehensive, irrelevant, inconsistent, duplicated, and overlapped data. In order to investigate how data quality may affect machine learning performance, we conducted a series of experiments on 11 host-based intrusion datasets using eight machine learning (ML) models and two pre-trained language models BERT and GPT-2. The experimental results showed: 1. BERT and GPT-2 outperformed the other models on every dataset. 2. Data duplications and overlaps in a dataset had different performance impacts on the pre-trained models and the classic ML models. The pre-trained models were less susceptible to duplicate and overlapped data than the classic ML models. 3. Removing overlaps and duplicates from training data with a normal range of sequence similarities could improve the pre-trained models' performances on most datasets. However, it may have adverse effects on model performance in datasets with highly similar sequences. 4. The reliability of model evaluation could be affected when testing data contains duplicates. 5. The overlapped rate between the normal class and the intrusion class seemed to have an inverse relationship to the performance of the pre-trained models in intrusion detection. Given the results, we proposed a framework for model selection and data quality assurance for building a high-quality machine learning-based intrusion detection system. © 2013 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

The performance models thus obtained are used for performance analysis of software under development. In previous work, we have used a specialized model transformation language, Epsilon ETL, to generate Layered Queueing Network (LQN) performance models from UML software models annotated with the MARTE profile. When the UML model evolves during the development process, the traditional solution for keeping the performance model synchronized is to rerun the entire transformation each time the software model changes. Such a solution is expensive, especially in large-scale models. In this paper, we propose an incremental change propagation (ICP) approach to propagate changes from the UML+MARTE software model to the corresponding LQN model. The entire process starts by automatically generating an LQN model with the previously developed Epsilon ETL transformation. During the development process, when the UML model evolves, we detect the changes with the Eclipse EMF Compare tool, then incrementally propagate them to the LQN model to keep it synchronized. Note that Epsilon does not support incremental model transformation. The proposed ICP is implemented with the Epsilon Object Language (EOL) and it is evaluated by applying it to a set of case studies. © 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

The context of synergetics makes it possible for scientists of different specializations to interact fruitfully in the language of systematic understanding and search for new solutions. The presented work raises the question of how the theory of self-organization can help in the reformation of the higher education system, why this is relevant, and what can lead to the training of both teachers and students within the framework of an interdisciplinary approach. In the future, we will highlight the most important characteristics of complex systems and the simplest and at the same time conceptually simplest methods for analyzing complexity. As part of the complex systems modeling course, which will first be presented to students of physics and mathematics, and then, possibly, to students of other specialties, we present signals of seismic activity, gravitational waves and magnetic activity, and demonstrate how we can identify critical or crash phenomena in such systems. This kind of analysis can serve as a good basis for the formation of professional skills and universal competencies. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

However, HMER remains challenging due to its own many characteristics such as the ambiguity of handwritten symbol, the two-dimensional characteristics of expression structure, and a large amount of context information. Inspired by research on machine translation and image caption, we proposed an Encoder-Decoder structure to recognize the handwritten mathematical expression. Encoder based dual attention is used to extract the features of the expression image and attention-decoder achieves symbol recognition and structural analysis. The mask information is added to the input data allows the model to better focus on the region of interest. In order to verify the effectiveness of our method, we train the model on the CROHME-2016 train set and use the CROHME-2014 test set as the validation set, the CROHME-2016 test set as the test set. The experimental results show that our method is greatly improved compared with other recognition methods, achieved respectively 47.49% and 45.10% ExpRate in the two test sets. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Especially, in Model Driven Engineering (MDE), they are considered as first-class elements instead of programming code and all software development activities move around these models. In MDE, programming code is automatically generated by the models and models’ defects can implicitly transfer to the code. These defects can harder to discover and rectify. Model verification is a promising solution to the problem. The Unified Modelling Language (UML) class model is an important part of UML and is used in both analysis and design. However, UML only provides graphical elements without any formal foundation. Therefore, verification of formal properties such as consistency, satisfiability and consequences are not possible in UML. This paper mainly focuses on ontology-based transformation and verification of the UML class model elements which have not been addressed in any existing verification methods e.g. xor association constraint, and dependencies relationships. We validate the scalability and effectiveness of the proposed solution using various UML class models. The empirical study shows that the proposed approach scales in the presence of the large and complex model. © 2020, Zarka Private University.

Thus, it is important to check the correctness of model transformation programs. Several approaches have been proposed to generate test cases for model transformations based on different coverage criteria (e.g., statements, rules, metamodel elements, etc.). However, the execution of a large number of test cases during the evolution of transformation programs is time-consuming and may include a lot of overlap between the test cases. In this paper, we propose a test case selection approach for model transformations based on multi-objective search. We use the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) to find the best trade-offs between two conflicting objectives: (1) maximize the coverage of rules and (2) minimize the execution time of the selected test cases. We validated our approach on several evolution cases of medium and large ATLAS Transformation Language programs. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

But as the size, structural complexity, and interdependencies between software components in larger systems grows, two-dimensional viewing and modeling has limitations, and new ways of visualizing larger models and numerous associated diagrams of different types are needed to intuitively convey structural and relational insights. To investigate the feasibility of using Virtual Reality (VR) to create an immersive UML-based software modeling experience, this paper contributes a VR solution concept for visualizing, navigating, modeling, and interacting with software models using UML notation. An implementation shows its feasibility while an empirical evaluation highlights its potential. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

However, most model-based approaches rely on static modeling languages and cannot handle runtime uncertainty (e.g. dynamically integrated resources) that requires online language extensions. In previous work, we proposed an approach to extend the system's modeling language with new monitoring and action dimensions. However, the solution generates a high number of new language elements, slowing down the reasoning process for large systems. In this position paper, we propose a multi-level approach for extending the modeling language at runtime, and aim to provide online learning and reasoning at multiple levels of abstraction. Increasing the modeling abstraction decreases the number of concepts to reason about, hence improving scalability. We provide a preliminary validation of this proposal by detecting novel abstract dimensions from monitoring data from the smart home domain. © 2021 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

However, most of the existing anomaly detection models are statically trained on pre-recorded data from a single source, thus making multiple assumptions about the surrounding environment. As a result, their usefulness is limited to controlled scenarios. In this paper, we fuse information from live streams of audio and video data to detect anomalies in the captured environment. We train a deep learning-based teacher-student network using video, image, and audio information. The pre-trained visual network in the teacher model distills its information to the image and audio networks in the student model. Features from image and audio networks are combined and compressed using principal component analysis. Thus, the teacher-student network produces an image-audio-based light-weight joint representation of the data. The data dynamics are learned in a multivariate adaptive Gaussian mixture model. Empirical results from two audio-visual datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of joint representation over single modalities in the adaptive anomaly detection framework.

However, a perfectly accurate transcript still can be challenging to read due to disfluency, filter words, and other errata common in spoken communication. Many downstream tasks and human readers rely on the output of the ASR system; therefore, errors introduced by the speaker and ASR system alike will be propagated to the next task in the pipeline. In this work, we propose an ASR post-processing model that aims to transform the incorrect and noisy ASR output into a readable text for humans and downstream tasks. We leverage the Metadata Extraction (MDE) corpus to construct a task-specific dataset for our study. Since the dataset is small, we propose a novel data augmentation method and use a two-stage training strategy to fine-tune the RoBERTa pre-trained model. On the constructed test set, our model outperforms a production two-step pipeline-based post-processing method by a large margin of 13.26 on readability-aware WER (RAWER) and 17.53 on BLEU metrics. Human evaluation also demonstrates that our method can generate more human-readable transcripts than the baseline method. © 2021 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

| No             |          | Assessing the Impact of Segmentation on Wheat Stripe Rust Disease Classification Using Computer Vision and Deep Learning                                                                                     | Wheat is a staple crop that is grown across the world due to its substantial contribution to human nutrition. Its significance is evident as it provides almost 20% of calories and protein required for daily human consumption. However, wheat yield is affected by rust disease that can reduce 30% of wheat production which is a serious threat to food security. In order to minimize the loss, it is crucial to identify precisely and localize the wheat rust disease and its infection types. For this purpose, several classification and segmentation techniques are used which are based on machine/deep learning models. This paper provides a realistic analysis and evaluation of various segmentation techniques including Watershed, Grab Cut, and U2-Net. These techniques are applied to the wheat stripe rust data to generate multiple datasets such as Watershed segmented data, GrabCut segmented data, and U2-Net segmented data. Subsequently, a pre-trained deep learning model, ResNet-18 is applied to these datasets to assess the impact of segmentation on classification accuracy. The highest classification accuracy (96.196%) is achieved on the dataset segmented by U2-Net. This research collates several state-of-the-art segmentation techniques in terms of correctness and their direct impact on classification accuracy which gives a pragmatic analysis for researchers to choose optimal segmentation technique. The research primarily focuses on the direct impact of segmentation on classification accuracy of wheat stripe rust, which has not been given sufficient focus in earlier researches. © 2013 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Its core Big Data arises from historical records from a variety of heterogeneous sources, some aspects are pre-digitized and machine readable. A huge data set (over 4 million records in each source) and its slow manual enrichment (ca 7,000 records processed so far) pose issues of quality, scalability, and creates the need for a quality assurance technology that is accessible to non-programmers. An important goal for the researcher community is to produce a reusable, high-level quality assurance tool for the ingested data that is domain specific (historic data), highly portable across data sources, thus independent of storage technology.This paper outlines the step-wise design of the finer granular digital format, aimed for storage and digital archiving, and the design and test of two generations of the techniques, used in the first two data ingestion and cleaning phases.The first small scale phase was exploratory, based on metadata enrichment transcription to Excel, and conducted in parallel with the design of the final digital format and the discovery of all the domain-specific rules and constraints for the syntax and semantic validity of individual entries. Excel embedded quality checks or database-specific techniques are not adequate due to the technology independence requirement. This first phase produced a Java parser with an embedded data cleaning and evaluation classifier, continuously improved and refined as insights grew. The next, larger scale phase uses a bespoke Historian Web Application that embeds the Java validator from the parser, as well as a new Boolean classifier for valid and complete data assurance built using a Model-Driven Development technique that we also describe. This solution enforces property constraints directly at data capture time, removing the need for additional parsing and cleaning stages. The new classifier is built in an easy to use graphical technology, and the ADD-Lib tool it uses is a modern low-code development environment that auto-generates code in a large number of programming languages. It thus meets the technology independence requirement and historians are now able to produce new classifiers themselves without being able to program. We aim to infuse the project with computational and archival thinking in order to produce a robust data set that is FAIR compliant (Free Accessible Inter-operable and Re-useable), © 2020 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

The organisations typically publish the results in a sustainability or non-financial report. We aim at offering a novel perspective from which researchers investigate, practitioners apply and policy-makers regulate ethical, social and environmental accounting (ESEA). The large quantity of ESEA methods and tools causes managerial problems, affecting the identity of social enterprises and complicating policy making. We will develop a domain-specific modelling language to specify existing ESEA methods and capture the advantages of model-driven engineering. We will create a repository where method models can be stored. These models contain the data structure and configuration of the methods. We will also develop openESEA, a run-time model interpreter that automatically executes ESEA method models. We will offer features to allow organisations to tailor the methods to their needs, to support model management operations, and to compare existing methods to inform policy makers about their similarities and differences. This project combines expertise in information science and social entrepreneurship with the intention to pave the way to future research avenues in ESEA and, eventually, to profound changes towards a fair and sustainable economy. © 2020 ACM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

In Production Systems Engineering (PSE), the planning of production systems involves domain experts from various domains, such as mechanical, electrical and software engineering collaborating and modeling their specific views on the system. These models, describing entire plants, can reach a large size (up to several GBs) with complex relationships and dependencies. Due to the size, ambiguous semantics and diverging views, consistency of data and the awareness of changes are challenging to track. Aim. In this paper we explore visualizations mechanisms for a model inspection tool to support consistency checking and the awareness of changes in multi-disciplinary PSE environments, as well has more efficient handing of AutomationML (AML) files. Method. We explore various visualization capabilities that are suitable for hierarchical structures common in PSE and identified requirements for a model-inspection tool for PSE purposes based on workshops with our company partner. A proof-of concept software prototype is developed based on the elicited requirements. Results. We evaluate the effectiveness of our Information Visualisation (InfoVis) approach in comparison to a standard modeling tool in PSE, the AutomationML Editor. The evaluation showed promising results for handling large-scale engineering models based on AML for the selected scenarios, but also areas for future improvement, such as more advanced capabilities. Conclusion. Although InfoVis was found useful in the evaluation context, in-depth analysis with domain experts from industry regarding usability and features remain for future work. © 2022 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

| No             |          | A study on fine-tuning wav2vec2.0 model for the task of mispronunciation detection and diagnosis                                                                                                             | Mispronunciation detection and diagnosis (MDD) technology is a key component of computer-assisted pronunciation training system (CAPT). The mainstream method is based on deep neural network automatic speech recognition. Unfortunately, the technique requires massive human-annotated speech recordings for training. Due to the huge variations in mother tongue, age, and proficiency level among second language learners, it is difficult to gather a large amount of matching data for acoustic model training, which greatly limits the model performance. In this paper, we explore the use of Self-Supervised Pretraining (SSP) model wav2vec2.0 for MDD tasks. SSP utilizes a large unlabelled dataset to learn general representation and can be applied in downstream tasks. We conduct experiments using two publicly available datasets (TIMIT, L2-arctic) and our best system achieves 60.44% f1-score.

To ensure data-consistency and sup-port synchronization between objects such systems often use distributed transactions with Two-Phase Locking (2pl) for concurrency control and Two-Phase commit (2pc) as atomic commitment protocol. Inquiry In highly available, high-throughput systems, such as large banking infrastructure, however, 2pl becomes a bottleneck when objects are highly contended, when an object is queuing a lot of messages because of locking. Approach In this paper we introduce Path-Sensitive Atomic Commit (psac) to address this situation. We start from message handlers (or methods), which are decorated with pre-and post-conditions, describing their guards and effect. Knowledge This allows the psac lock mechanism to check whether the effect of two incoming messages at the same time are independent, and to avoid locking if this is the case. As a result, more messages are directly accepted or rejected, and higher overall throughput is obtained. Grounding We have implemented psac for a state machine-based DSL called Rebel, on top of a runtime based on the Akka actor framework. Our performance evaluation shows that psac exhibits the same scalability and latency characteristics as standard 2pl/2pc, and obtains up to 1.8 times median higher throughput in congested scenarios. Importance We believe psac is a step towards enabling organizations to build scalable distributed applica-tions, even if their consistency requirements are not embarrassingly parallel.

| No             |          | Service relationship orchestration: Lessons learned from running large scale smart city platforms on kubernetes                                                                                              | Smart cities aim to make urban life more enjoyable and sustainable but their highly heterogeneous and distributed context creates unique operational challenges. In such an environment, multiple companies work together with government on applications and data streams spanning several management domains. Deploying these applications, each of which consists of several connected services, and maintaining an overview of application topologies remains difficult. Even though cloud modelling languages have been proposed to solve similar issues, they are not well fit for such a heterogeneous environment because they often require an 'all or nothing' approach. Moreover, cloud modelling languages add an additional abstraction layer that rarely supports all features of the underlying platform and make it harder to reuse existing knowledge and tools. This research defines service relationships as the key element to modelling applications as topologies of services. We use this definition to pinpoint what is lacking in the state of the art Kubernetes orchestration tools and provide a blueprint for how relationship support can be added to any orchestrator. We present 'orcon', a proof of concept orchestrator that extends the Kubernetes API to allow managing relationships between services by adding metadata to service definitions. Our evaluation shows this orchestrator enables lifecycle synchronization and configuration change propagation with an overhead of only 0.44 seconds per service. © 2013 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Though MBSE models provide a completely structural formalisms about system development for system developers, such large of domain specific knowledge represented by models cannot be captured as what the developers expect. This leads to a big challenge when MBSE can be widely used for complex system development. In this paper, a knowledge management approach is proposed to support an intelligent question answering scenario when implementing MBSE in system lifecycle. We make use of the GOPPRR approach to support MBSE formalisms which are transformed to knowledge graph models. Then such models provide cues for intelligent question answers through reasoning. In the case study, we make use of an auto-braking system scenario to develop MBSE models and to implement the intelligent question answering. Finally, we find the availability of our approach is evaluated which the domain engineers enable to capture their domain knowledge more efficiently. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| No             |          | The mathematical foundations of physical systems modeling languages                                                                                                                                          | Modern modeling languages for general physical systems, such as Modelica, Amesim, or Simscape, rely on Differential Algebraic Equations (DAEs), i.e., constraints of the form f(x′,x,u)=0. This drastically facilitates modeling from first principles of the physics, as well as the reuse of models. In this paper, we develop the mathematical theory needed to establish the development of compilers and tools for DAE-based physical modeling languages on solid mathematical bases. Unlike Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs, of the form x′=g(x,u)), DAEs exhibit subtle issues because of the notion of differentiation index and related latent equations—ODEs are DAEs of index zero, for which no latent equation needs to be considered. Prior to generating execution code and calling solvers, the compilation of such languages requires a nontrivial structural analysis step that reduces the differentiation index to a level acceptable by DAE solvers. The models supported by tools of the Modelica class involve multiple modes, with mode-dependent DAE-based dynamics and state-dependent mode switching. However, multimode DAEs are much more difficult to handle than DAEs, especially because of the events of mode change. Unfortunately, the large literature devoted to the mathematical analysis of DAEs does not cover the multimode case, typically saying nothing about mode changes. This lack of foundations causes numerous difficulties to the existing modeling tools. Some models are well handled, others are not, with no clear boundary between the two classes. In this paper, we develop a comprehensive mathematical approach supporting compilation and code generation for this class of languages. Its core is the structural analysis of multimode DAE systems. As a byproduct of this structural analysis, we propose sound criteria for accepting or rejecting multimode models. Our mathematical development relies on nonstandard analysis, which allows us to cast hybrid system dynamics to discrete-time dynamics with infinitesimal step size, thus providing a uniform framework for handling both continuous dynamics and mode change events. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Design pattern is one of them to provide the solution for a design problem, which is recurring in nature. In this approach, we have presented design patterns for the IoT use cases such as service integration and IoT security. But the semi-formal nature of software patterns may lead to bugs in the proposed pattern. Hence, an ontology-based approach is considered for modelling of the IoT design patterns. Further, we have presented an ontology-based framework for the specification and refinement of IoT design patterns. In this approach, an analysis of meta-models and ontologies has also been performed for reducing the gap between high-level design abstraction of Unified Modeling Language (UML)-based IoT patterns and formal ontology. © 2021 World Scientific Publishing Co.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

As of 2022, the top five LMs on the SuperGLUE benchmark leaderboard have exceeded the gold standard. Even people with good general knowledge will struggle to solve problems in specialized fields such as medicine and artificial intelligence. Just as humans learn specialized knowledge through bachelor's, master's, and doctoral courses, LMs also require a process to develop the ability to understand domain specific knowledge. Thus, this study proposes SciDeBERTa and SciDeBERTa(CS) as a pre-trained LM (PLM) specialized in the science technology domain. We further pretrain the DeBERTa, which was trained with a general corpus, with the science technology domain corpus. Experiments verified that SciDeBERTa(CS) continually pre-trained in the computer science domain achieved 3.53% and 2.17% higher accuracies than SciBERT and S2ORC-SciBERT, respectively, which are science technology domain specialized PLMs, in the task of recognizing entity names in SciERC dataset. In the JRE task of the SciERC dataset, SciDeBERTa(CS) demonstrated a 6.7% higher performance than baseline SCIIE. In the Genia dataset, SciDeBERTa achieved the best performance compared to S2ORC-SciBERT, SciBERT, BERT, DeBERTa and SciDeBERTa(CS). Furthermore, re-initialization technology and optimizers after Adam were explored during fine-tuning to verify the language understanding of PLMs. © 2013 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Execution tracing, the basis of various dynamic analysis methods includes the collection of events, metrics, and statistics about the runtime behaviors of systems and applications. However, comprehensive execution tracing can result in very large trace files, most of which are irrelevant to the problem at hand. This is compounded by the inflexibility and complexity of common tools in how the user specifies what to capture, making the collection of relevant statistics difficult. While existing solutions allow for an adaptive collection of metrics and statistics, they often require users to write large and complex scripts in a domain-specific language. In this paper, we propose a state machine based modeling tool that simplifies the creation of user-defined and data-driven trace-based analyses. The proposed method combines advanced kernel-space and user-space execution trace events with powerful and adaptable modeling in order to automatically generating event-based analysis based on users' specific requirements and problems. The difficulty and complexity of user-defined event tracing is drastically reduced. We demonstrate the efficiency, effectiveness, and simplicity of our proposed tool through real use cases of multi-level dynamic execution tracing in the Linux kernel. © 2021 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Over the years, many languages tailored to this special task, so-called model transformation languages, have been developed. A multitude of advantages have been proclaimed as reasons to why these dedicated languages are better suited to the task of transforming models than general purpose programming languages. However, little work has been done to confirm many of these claims. In this paper, we analyse ATL transformation scripts from various sources to investigate three common claims about the expressiveness of model transformation languages. The claims we are interested in assert that automatic trace handling and implicit rule ordering are huge advantages for model transformation languages and that model transformation languages are able to hide complex semantics behind simple syntax. We use complexity measures to analyse the distribution of complexity over transformation modules and to gain insights about what this means for the abstractions used by ATL. We found that a large portion of the complexity of transformations stem from simple attribute assignments. We also found indications for the usefulness of conditioning on types, implicit rule ordering and automatic trace resolution. © 2020 Association Internationale pour les Technologies Objets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

The use of code generators in these technologies helps significantly increase productivity and achieve large scale software reuse. However, there have been no work that address incremental construction of RESTful full stack software (RFS) at both the module and software levels. In this paper, we propose a generative module-based method for RFS to bridge this gap. We characterise an essential RFS and realise this in a module-based DDD software architecture, named MOSAR. Our method takes as input a software configuration and the required software assets and automatically generates a module-based RFS software. We present algorithms for the frontend and backend generation functions. The backend software consist of web service modules. The frontend software consists of modules that are designed with single-page views. Each view can be nested to reflect the containment tree of the module.

Academics and companies have made great strides in the theoretical research and case studies of constructing the shop-floor digital twin (SDT), which is the premise of applying DT technology on the shop floor. A shop floor is a large complex system that involves many elements including people, machines, materials, methods, and the environment and processes, such as the technical flow, business process, logistics, and control flow. However, most of the developed cases lack a hierarchical, structured and modularized implementation framework for the development of an SDT system, which leads to problems such as a low reuse rate of the system blocks, lack of scalability, and high upgrade and maintenance costs. In response to these issues, we propose a construction method of the DT for the shop floor based on model-based systems engineering from the perspective of the system. In this method, a comprehensive DT model for the shop floor is gradually constructed by using system modeling language, the modeling method “MagicGrid,” and the “V model” of systems engineering. The model includes four dimensions of the shop-floor requirements, structure, behavior, and parameters, as well as three stages (the problem domain, solution domain, and implementation domain), and connects nine steps of the “V model,” including the system requirements, system architecture, subsystem implementation, subsystem integration, and system verification. Then, based on an example of a real NC machining shop floor, subsystems including a visualization system, synchronization system, and simulation system, are discussed. Finally, the functions of the integrated systems are verified based on the requirements, including the real-time synchronization of “man, machine, material, and method” and the transient simulation in real time. The numerical indicators of the integrated system are verified, including the model completeness and synchronization timeliness. © 2021 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

These large-scale models pose scalability issues for model-driven engineering technologies. These models can be persisted in various backend technologies (such as file systems, document and relational databases) and can be represented in different formats such as XMI and Flexmi. Several tailored high-level model management languages such as OCL and EOL enable developers to work on different backend technologies in a uniform way by shielding them from the complexities of different backends. On the contrary, performance with respect to execution time in tailored model management languages programs becomes one of the major scalability bottlenecks. In this work, we propose an architecture built on top of existing model query languages to facilitate query optimisation. The proposed approach will benefit from compile-time static analysis and automatic program rewriting to optimise queries operating over heterogeneous backend technologies. Optimisation strategies and performance will vary depending on the type of queries and the backend modelling technology. We expect to significantly improve performance (decrease in one order of magnitude of execution time) for model management programs, particularly over large-scale models. © 2021 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Such heterogeneous systems involve numerous domains with competencies and expertise that go far beyond traditional software engineering: systems engineering. In this paper, we explore a model-based approach for systems engineering that advocates the composition of several heterogeneous artifacts (called views) into a sound and consistent system model. A model combination Language is proposed for this purpose. Thus, rather than trying to build the universal language able to capture all possible aspects of systems, the proposed language proposes to relate small subsets of languages in order to offer specific analysis capabilities while keeping a global consistency between all joined models. We demonstrate the interest of our approach through an industrial process based on Capella, which provides (among others) a large support for functional analysis from requirements to components deployment. Even though Capella is already quite expressive, it lacks support for schedulability analysis. AADL is also a language dedicated to system analysis. If it is backed with advanced schedulability tools, it lacks support for functional analysis. Thus, instead of proposing ways to add missing aspects in either Capella or AADL, we rather extract a relevant subset of both languages to build a view adequate for conducting schedulability analysis of Capella functional models. Finally, our combination language is generic enough to extract pertinent subsets of languages and combine them to build views for different experts. It also helps maintaining a global consistency between different modeling views. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Control engineers design and implement software for such systems using standardized programming languages (IEC 61131-3) and still require substantial manual work causing high engineering costs and potential quality issues. Methods for automatically generating control logic using knowledge extraction from formal requirements documents have been developed, but so far only been demonstrated in simplified lab settings. We have executed four case studies on large industrial plants with thousands of sensors and actuators for a rule-based control logic generation approach called CAYENNE to determine its practicability.We found that we can generate more than 70 percent of the required interlocking control logic with code generation rules that are applicable across different plants. This can lead to estimated overall development cost savings of up to 21 percent, which provides a promising outlook for methods in this class. © 2020 IEEE Computer Society.

FL is also helpful in reengineering a family of software products into a Software Product Line (SPL). Despite the popularity of FL, there is no study that evaluates the influence of scope (single product or product family) when engineers perform FL. Objective: The goal of this paper is to compare the performance, productivity, and perceived difficulty of manual FL when scope changes from a single product to a product family. Method: We conducted a crossover experiment to compare the performance, productivity, and perceived difficulty of manual FL when scope changes. The experimental objects are extracted from a real-world SPL that uses a Domain-Specific Language to generate the firmware of its products. Results: Performance and productivity decrease significantly when engineers locate features in a product family regardless of their experience. For these variables the impact of the FL Scope is medium–large. On contrast, for perceived difficulty, the magnitude of the difference is moderate and is not significant. Conclusions: While performance and productivity decrease significantly when engineers locate features in a product family, the difficulty they perceive does not predict the significant worsening of the results. Our work also identifies strengths and weaknesses in FL. This can help in developing better FL approaches and test cases for evaluation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Verifying whether a model satisfies a set of requirements is considered to be an important challenge in DSM, but is nevertheless mostly neglected. We present a solution in the form of ProMoBox, a framework that integrates the definition and verification of temporal properties in discrete-time behavioural DSMLs, whose semantics can be described as a schedule of graph rewrite rules. Thanks to the expressiveness of graph rewriting, this covers a very large class of problems. With ProMoBox, the domain user models not only the system with a DSML, but also its properties, input model, run-time state and output trace. A DSML is thus comprised of five sublanguages, which share domain-specific syntax, and are generated from a single metamodel. Generic transformations to and from a verification backbone ensure that both the language engineer and the domain user are shielded from underlying notations and techniques. We explicitly model the ProMoBox framework's process in the paper. Furthermore, we evaluate ProMoBox to assert that it supports the specification and verification of properties in a highly flexible and automated way. © 1976-2012 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Knowledge graphs have been used to summarize large amounts of textual data, therefore facilitating information retrieval, but they require programming and machine learning skills not usually available to domains specialists. To bridge this gap, this work proposes a framework, KG4All (Knowledge Graphs for All), to allow for domain specialists to build and interact with a knowledge graph created from their own chosen corpus. In order to build the knowledge graph, a transition-based system model is used to extract and link medical entities, with tokens represented as embeddings from the prefix, suffix, shape and lemmatized features of individual words. We used abstracts from the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge (CORD-19) as corpus to test the framework. The results include an online prototype and correspondent source code. Preliminary results show that it is possible to automate the extraction of entity relations from medical text and to build an interactive user knowledge graph without programming background. © 2021, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

However, spreadsheet-based solutions are hard to maintain, reuse, integrate, and scale. This paper describes an approach for supporting 'DevOps for business users' that enables business-level users to manage the full lifecycle of a large class of cloud-hosted business processes. The approach builds on DevOps for software engineering, but removes software engineers from the loop. Unlike general-purpose 'low code' business process management systems, the approach incorporates aspects of a processing domain (e.g., billing) to create a DevOps experience that business users can master easily. In the approach, business users follow an agile 'specify-check-generate-deploy' methodology, enabling them to rapidly and iteratively generate and operationalize cloud-hosted processing systems, with little or no assistance from IT staff. We demonstrate and evaluate the approach using a system built for the billing application area, developed at IBM, which provides technology support and maintenance services for numerous clients, each with different billing needs and logic.

MDD research in Mandarin is faced with the problem of lack of relevant data, which is a typical low-resource scenario. In recent years, self-supervised pre-trained speech representation has developed rapidly and achieved significant performance improvement in low-resource speech recognition scenarios, making it necessary to be applied to MDD tasks. First, we build a Mandarin MDD dataset called PSC-Reading for the Putonghua Proficiency Test (PSC) passage reading section. Then we extended the end-to-end MDD system based on CTC/Attention hybrid architecture and Transformer architecture, using features extracted from self-supervised pre-training speech representation models such as Wav2Vec 2.0 and WavLM to replace conventional speech features like MFCC and Fbank, and conduct experiments on the PSC-Reading dataset. Experimental results show that, compared with the baseline model CNN-RNN-CTC, our WavLM-based model obtains 20.5% relative improvement on the F1 score metric. © 2013 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

In Production Systems Engineering (PSE), the planning of production systems involves domain experts from various domains, such as mechanical, electrical and software engineering collaborating and modeling their specific views on the system. These models, describing entire plants, can reach a large size (up to several GBs) with complex relationships and dependencies. Due to the size, ambiguous semantics and diverging views, consistency of data and the awareness of changes are challenging to track. Aim. In this paper we explore visualizations mechanisms for a model inspection tool to support consistency checking and the awareness of changes in multi-disciplinary PSE environments, as well has more efficient handing of AutomationML (AML) files. Method. We explore various visualization capabilities that are suitable for hierarchical structures common in PSE and identified requirements for a model-inspection tool for PSE purposes based on workshops with our company partner. A proof-of concept software prototype is developed based on the elicited requirements. Results. We evaluate the effectiveness of our Information Visualisation (InfoVis) approach in comparison to a standard modeling tool in PSE, the AutomationML Editor. The evaluation showed promising results for handling large-scale engineering models based on AML for the selected scenarios, but also areas for future improvement, such as more advanced capabilities. Conclusion. Although InfoVis was found useful in the evaluation context, in-depth analysis with domain experts from industry regarding usability and features remain for future work.

However, they are faced with the challenge of preserving consistency between software-visible variables and faulty microarchitectural states. The goal of this work is to determine a suitable accelerator modelling that enables analysis without overloading the simulation engine. Toward this goal, the paper explores different accelerator modelling strategies featuring increasing levels of hardware visibility. They are compared in their capability to gain insights into the reliability of the multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) pipeline of an industry-standard deep learning accelerator from NVIDIA. Our results show that subtle microarchitectural details that are typically overlooked by competing approaches play a relevant role in determining accelerator reliability. © 2022 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

There are many tools used to support the implementation of a DSL, making hard the decision-making process for one or another. In this sense, identifying and mapping their features is relevant for decision-making by academic and industrial initiative on DSL development. Objective: The goal of this work is to identify and map the tools, Language Workbenches (LW), or frameworks that were proposed to develop DSLs discussed and referenced in publications between 2012 and 2019. Method: A Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) of the literature scoping tools for DSL development. Results: We identified 59 tools, including 9 under a commercial license and 41 with non-commercial licenses, and analyzed their features from 230 papers. Conclusion: There is a substantial amount of tools that cover a large number of features. Furthermore, we observed that usually, the developer adopts one type of notation to implement the DSL: textual or graphical. We also discuss research gaps, such as a lack of tools that allow meta-meta model transformations and that support modeling tools interoperability. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

However, at present, there is no single formal method that can fully meet the modeling and verification requirements of concurrent systems. In this paper, we propose an integrated formal method that utilizes both event-based method Event-B and state-based formalism LTS to address this problem. We first analyze the difference and connection between Event-B and LTS in building system models and then propose to use the graphical front-end iUML-B of Event-B to obtain a unified representation with LTS so as to take their advantages in the integrated method. Finally, we carry out a case study to demonstrate the practicality of the proposed method. The case study shows that our method effectively models and verifies the various properties of the system, and to a large extent makes up for the shortcomings of a single formal method in the process of system modeling and verification. © 2013 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| No             |          | Exploring and managing the complexity of large infrastructure projects with network theory and model-based systems engineering—The example of radioactive waste disposal                                     | Given that model-based systems engineering (MBSE) captures the structure and behavior of an engineered system in an overarching system model, MBSE appears to be a promising approach to managing large infrastructure projects (LIPs). However, it is not apparent how to most appropriately organize the associated system model—and hence the infrastructure project itself. Furthermore, MBSE may today not be readily accepted by the civil engineering industry. In this research, a hypothetical project for the geological disposal of radioactive waste is taken as an example of an LIP and initial system models of the entire disposal project are created. Furthermore, a network representation of the project is generated and examined with network theory. Based on the results, different project organizations are synthesized and evaluated. Eventually, the initial system models are updated to accommodate the most suitable organization according to the network analysis results. In addition, the perception of, and attitude toward MBSE is assessed by means of a cross-sectional survey in a civil engineering company. The generation of system models of LIPs is found to be straightforward. Network theory is able to unveil the complex structure of LIPs in order to identify the most suitable way to organize them and the associated system models.

| No             |          | Ethically Responsible Machine Learning in Fintech                                                                                                                                                            | Rapid technological developments in the last decade have contributed to using machine learning (ML) in various economic sectors. Financial institutions have embraced technology and have applied ML algorithms in trading, portfolio management, and investment advising. Large-scale automation capabilities and cost savings make the ML algorithms attractive for personal and corporate finance applications. Using ML applications in finance raises ethical issues that need to be carefully examined. We engage a group of experts in finance and ethics to evaluate the relationship between ethical principles of finance and ML. The paper compares the experts’ findings with the results obtained using natural language processing (NLP) transformer models, given their ability to capture the semantic text similarity. The results reveal that the finance principles of integrity and fairness have the most significant relationships with ML ethics. The study includes a use case with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Microsoft Responsible AI Widgets explainability tools for error analysis and visualization of ML models. It analyzes credit card approval data and demonstrates that the explainability tools can address ethical issues in fintech, and improve transparency, thereby increasing the overall trustworthiness of ML models. The results show that both humans and machines could err in approving credit card requests despite using their best judgment based on the available information. Hence, human-machine collaboration could contribute to improved decision-making in finance. We propose a conceptual framework for addressing ethical challenges in fintech such as bias, discrimination, differential pricing, conflict of interest, and data protection. © 2022 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

The rapid growth of hardware and emerging technologies has resulted in a large number of mobile platforms\*which constitutes a challenge that developers must face when they build applications for different platforms. The model-based artefacts co-evolution is another challenge when metamodel evolves. This paper introduces a model-driven approach for managing the metamodel evolution in the context of cross-platform mobile application development. Firstly\*we propose an MDD approach\*based on a generic DSL and a set of code generators to generate platform-specific source code. Secondly\*the approach provides a graphical framework: (i) to extend the original metamodel through a set of rules\*(ii) to define the mapping between the newly added meta-elements and their corresponding in the target platforms and (iii) to automatically update existing code generators. This paper demonstrates the potentials and limits of our approach through a concrete case study. © 2022 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd..

To maintain fast inference speed, most of the existing networks make use of light decoders, or they simply do not use them at all. This strategy helps to maintain a fast inference speed; however, their accuracy performance is significantly lower in comparison to non-real-time semantic segmentation networks. In this paper, we introduce two key modules aimed to design a high-performance decoder for real-time semantic segmentation for reducing the accuracy gap between real-time and non-real-time segmentation networks. Our first module, Dilated Asymmetric Pyramidal Fusion (DAPF), is designed to substantially increase the receptive field on the top of the last stage of the encoder, obtaining richer contextual features. Our second module, Multi-resolution Dilated Asymmetric (MDA) module, fuses and refines detail and contextual information from multi-scale feature maps coming from early and deeper stages of the network. Both modules exploit contextual information without excessively increasing the computational complexity by using asymmetric convolutions. Our proposed network entitled “FASSD-Net” reaches 78.8% of mIoU accuracy on the Cityscapes validation dataset at 41.1 FPS on full resolution images (1024×2048). Besides, with a light version of our network, we reach 74.1% of mIoU at 133.1 FPS (full resolution) on a single NVIDIA GTX 1080Ti card with no additional acceleration techniques.

Many experiments have confirmed that the ASAS system is not good enough, because its performance is limited by the training data. Focusing on the problem, we propose MDA-ASAS, multiple data augmentation strategies for improving performance on automatic short answer scoring. MDA-ASAS is designed to learn language representation enhanced by data augmentation strategies, which includes back-translation, correct answer as reference answer, and swap content. We argue that external knowledge has a profound impact on the ASAS process. Meanwhile, the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model has been shown to be effective for improving many natural language processing tasks, which acquires more semantic, grammatical and other features in large amounts of unsupervised data, and actually adds external knowledge. Combining with the latest BERT model, our experimental results on the ASAS dataset show that MDAASAS brings a significant gain over state-of-art.We also perform extensive ablation studies and suggest parameters for practical use. © 2020, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

The Arrowhead community aims at delivering mechanisms and technologies to cope with such complex scenarios. In particular, the concept of local clouds constitutes a service-oriented architecture (SOA) framework for IIoT. Here, a central challenge is the conceptual modeling of such use-cases. SysML is widely established as a standardized modeling language and framework for large-scale systems engineering and, thus, for Arrowhead local cloud designs. However, SysML and its Arrowhead profile lack a canonical way to support actual platform modeling and device involvement in heavily distributed IIoT scenarios. The Eclipse Vorto project is ideal for filling this gap: it provides a modeling language for IoT devices, a set of modeling tools, and already existing reusable templates of device models. In this paper, we propose an approach to integrating Eclipse Vorto models into Arrowhead SysML models. We illustrate the concept with a realistic yet comprehensible industrial scenario and also present a prototype to emphasize the benefits of our novel integration platform.

Graphical modeling offers the possibility to convey information about resource flows in production systems with different actors in a convenient and comprehensive way. This is particularly important for industrial symbiosis in which large and diverse production systems involving different companies are investigated. However, methodical guidance and a uniform modeling language to support the mapping of these flows and systems are lacking. Hence, this paper provides a modeling method (RFD-IS) for practitioners and researchers to map and analyze material and energy flows suitable for different industrial systems in order to identify underutilized resources and potentials for intra-and interfirm resource reuse. A uniform modeling method is indispensable for a common understanding and as a working document. © 2021 ACM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| No             |          | A formal approach to AADL model-based software engineering                                                                                                                                                   | Formal methods have become a recommended practice in safety-critical software engineering. To be formally verified, a system should be specified with a specific formalism such as Petri nets, automata and process algebras, which requires a formal expertise and may become complex especially with large systems. In this paper, we report our experience in the formal verification of safety-critical real-time systems. We propose a formal mapping for a real-time task model using the LNT language, and we describe how it is used for the integration of a formal verification phase in an AADL model-based development process. We focus on real-time systems with event-driven tasks, asynchronous communication and preemptive fixed-priority scheduling. We provide a complete tool-chain for the automatic model transformation and formal verification of AADL models. Experimentation illustrates our results with the Flight control system and Line follower robot case studies. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

The basic idea is to distinguish historical conceptual models and historical works models, so as to support large and medium-scale historical compilations of 'top-down, gradual refinement'. It focuses on defining the historical concept modeling language, and designing its abstract grammar, concrete grammar and semantics. Based on MetaEdit+, a preliminary graphical historical concept modeling tool is designed and implemented. © 2021 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Numerous annotated corpora and state-of-the-art models have been introduced in the past five years. However, there are no general guidelines about evaluating models on these corpora in single- and cross-domain settings with diverse entities and relation types. We aim to fill this gap for the task of detecting whether a relation holds between two biomedical entities given a text span. In this work, we present a fine-grained evaluation intended to perform a comparative evaluation of four biomedical benchmarks and understand the efficiency of state-of-the-art neural architectures based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) with cross-attention and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) for relation extraction across two main domains, namely scientific abstracts and electronic health records. We present a comparative evaluation of biomedical RE datasets, including the PHAEDRA, i2b2/VA, BC5CDR, and MADE corpora. Our evaluation of BioBERT and LSTM for binary classification shows significant divergence in in-domain and out-of-domain performance, finding an average drop in F1-measure of 34.2% for BioBERT. The cross-attention LSTM model developed in this work exhibits better cross-domain performance, with a drop of only 27.6% in F-measure. © 2013 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Another scenario is the automatic generation of OCL code by a repair system. These generated expressions tend to be complex and unreadable due to the nature of the generative process. However, to be useful this code should be simple and resemble manually written code as much as possible when a developer must manually maintain it. There exists refactorings approaches for manually written OCL code, but there is no tool targeted to the optimisation of OCL expressions which have been automatically synthesised. Moreover, there is no available catalogue of OCL refactorings which can be integrated seamlessly into a tool. In this work, we contribute a set of refactorings intended to optimise OCL expressions, notably covering cases likely to arise in generated OCL code. We also contribute the implementation of these refactorings, built as a generic transformation catalogue using bentō, a transformation reuse tool for ATL. This makes it possible to specialise the catalogue for any OCL variant based on Ecore. Moreover, we propose a method to verify the correctness of the implemented catalogue based on translation validation and model finding. We describe the design and implementation of the catalogue and evaluate it by optimising a large amount of OCL expressions and proving the correctness of each optimisation execution. We also derive working implementations of the catalogue for ATL, EMF/OCL and SimpleOCL made available in a tool called BeautyOCL. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

The most visible consequence of this has been the explosion of interest and application of large language models such as ChatGPT. This is one exemplar of how a foundation model trained on a huge amount of data can be specialised for particular task, often by a phase of reinforcement learning with human feedback.Within the AI community "performance" of such systems is generally taken to mean how well they respond to their users on characteristics such as accuracy, verifiability, and bias. Performance analysis usually considers both the responsiveness of a system to its user and the efficiency and equity of resource use. These foundation models rely on massive amounts of resource but there appears to have been little work considering how to understand the resource use or the trade-offs that exist between how the system responds to users and the amount of resource used.In this talk I will present initial ideas of what it could mean to develop a framework of performance evaluation for foundation models such as large language models. Such a framework would need to take into consideration the distinct phases of operation for these models, which broadly speaking can be categorised as training, generating and fine-tuning. Evaluating the trade-off between user interests and resource management will require the identification of suitable metrics. Resources in such systems are more than simply compute and storage use, and bandwidth; data and even human resources also play crucial roles in training and fine-tuning. I will discuss all these topics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

We fine-tune pre-existing LLMs on Verilog datasets compiled from GitHub and Verilog textbooks. We evaluate the functional correctness of the generated Verilog code using a specially designed test suite, featuring a custom problem set and testing benches. Here, our fine-tuned open-source CodeGen-16B model outperforms the commercial state-of-the-art GPT-3.5-turbo model with a 1.1% overall increase. Upon testing with a more diverse and complex problem set, we find that the fine-tuned model shows competitive performance against state-of-the-art gpt-3.5-turbo, excelling in certain scenarios. Notably, it demonstrates a 41% improvement in generating syntactically correct Verilog code across various problem categories compared to its pre-trained counterpart, highlighting the potential of smaller, in-house LLMs in hardware design automation. We release our training/evaluation scripts and LLM checkpoints as open-source contributions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

TestGen-LLM verifies that its generated test classes successfully clear a set of filters that assure measurable improvement over the original test suite, thereby eliminating problems due to LLM hallucination. We describe the deployment of TestGen-LLM at Meta test-a-thons for the Instagram and Facebook platforms. In an evaluation on Reels and Stories products for Instagram, 75% of TestGen-LLM’s test cases built correctly, 57% passed reliably, and 25% increased coverage. During Meta’s Instagram and Facebook test-a-thons, it improved 11.5% of all classes to which it was applied, with 73% of its recommendations being accepted for production deployment by Meta software engineers. We believe this is the first report on industrial scale deployment of LLM-generated code backed by such assurances of code improvement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| No             |          | MindfulDiary: Harnessing Large Language Model to Support Psychiatric Patients' Journaling                                                                                                                    | Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising opportunities in mental health domains, although their inherent complexity and low controllability elicit concern regarding their applicability in clinical settings. We present MindfulDiary, an LLM-driven journaling app that helps psychiatric patients document daily experiences through conversation. Designed in collaboration with mental health professionals, MindfulDiary takes a state-based approach to safely comply with the experts’ guidelines while carrying on free-form conversations. Through a four-week field study involving 28 patients with major depressive disorder and five psychiatrists, we examined how MindfulDiary facilitates patients’ journaling practice and clinical care. The study revealed that MindfulDiary supported patients in consistently enriching their daily records and helped clinicians better empathize with their patients through an understanding of their thoughts and daily contexts. Drawing on these findings, we discuss the implications of leveraging LLMs in the mental health domain, bridging the technical feasibility and their integration into clinical settings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Manual detection can be time-consuming and error-prone, making real-time anomaly detection necessary. By implementing runtime performance anomaly detection models, microservice systems can become more stable and reliable. However, anomaly detection alone is not enough, and complementary auto-remediation techniques are required to automatically detect and fix issues. Auto-remediation techniques can optimize resource allocation, tune code, or trigger automatic recovery mechanisms. The combination of anomaly detection and auto-remediation reduces downtime and enhances system reliability, resulting in increased productivity and customer satisfaction, which, in turn, drives higher revenue. Prior works have overlooked auto-remediation. In this work in progress paper, we propose a pipeline for automatic anomaly detection and remediation based on Large Language Models (LLMs).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

However, the results obtained from these tools may not always provide a comprehensive and complete view of a site's accessibility status. The main purpose of this study is to improve web accessibility by automatically remediating non-accessible ones using Large Language Models (LLM), particularly ChatGPT. The effectiveness of the used model in detecting and remediating accessibility issues to ensure compliance with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1) is also discussed. By using ChatGPT as a remediation tool, this study investigates the potential of LLM in improving web accessibility. In the case study, two websites that did not adhere to the WCAG 2.1 guidelines were selected as the primary experimental subjects for the study. These websites were assessed using the web accessibility evaluation tool, WAVE, to detect accessibility issues. The identified issues served then as the basis for remediation using ChatGPT. The effectiveness of the used advanced language model as a web accessibility remediation tool was evaluated by comparing its findings with those obtained from manual accessibility testing. The results of this comparison have significant implications for stakeholders involved in achieving WCAG compliance and contribute to the development of more accessible online platforms for individuals with disabilities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

We illustrate how two state-of-the-art open-source modeling tools, namely MontiAnna and ML-Quadrat can be used for this purpose as demonstrated through a case study. The case study illustrates using ML, in particular deep Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), for automated image recognition of handwritten digits using the MNIST reference dataset, and integrating the machine learning components into an IoT-system. Subsequently, we conduct a functional comparison of the two frameworks, setting out an analysis base to include a broad range of design considerations, such as the problem domain, methods for the ML integration into larger systems, and supported ML methods, as well as topics of recent intense interest to the ML community, such as AutoML and MLOps. Accordingly, this paper is focused on elucidating the potential of the MDE approach in the ML domain. This supports the ML-engineer in developing the (ML/software) model rather than implementing the code, and additionally enforces reusability and modularity of the design through enabling the out-of-the-box integration of ML functionality as a component of the IoT or cyber-physical systems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Modeling standards like EAST-ADL have shown promising results to reduce complexity and expedite system development. However, such standards are unable to cope with the growing demands of the automotive industry. A typical example of this phenomenon is autonomous vehicle perception (AVP) where deep learning architectures (DLA) are required for computer vision (CV) tasks like real-time object recognition and detection. However, existing modeling standards in the automotive industry are unable to manage such CV tasks at a higher abstraction level. Consequently, system development is currently accomplished through modeling approaches like EAST-ADL while DLA-based CV features for AVP are implemented in isolation at a lower abstraction level. This significantly compromises productivity due to integration challenges. In this article, we introduce MoDLF - A Model-Driven Deep learning Framework to design deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) architectures for AVP tasks. Particularly, Model Driven Architecture (MDA) is leveraged to propose a metamodel along with a conformant graphical modeling workbench to model DCNNs for CV tasks in AVP at a higher abstraction level. Furthermore, Model-To-Text (M2T) transformations are provided to generate executable code for MATLAB® and Python. The framework is validated via two case studies on benchmark datasets for key AVP tasks. The results prove that MoDLF effectively enables model-driven architectural exploration of deep convnets for AVP system development while supporting integration with renowned existing standards like EAST-ADL.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

However, it is complex and resource-consuming. We propose an automated approach for the extraction of UML class diagrams from natural language software specifications. To develop our approach, we create a dataset of UML class diagrams and their English specifications with the help of volunteers. Our approach is a pipeline of steps consisting of the segmentation of the input into sentences, the classification of the sentences, the generation of UML class diagram fragments from sentences, and the composition of these fragments into one UML class diagram. We develop a quantitative testing framework specific to UML class diagram extraction. Our approach yields low precision and recall but serves as a benchmark for future research.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

For example, this applies when new data versions arise from either a generated or aggregated extension of an existing dataset a model has already been trained on. In this work, it is investigated on how a model-based approach for these training data concerns can be provided as well as how the complete process, including the resulting training and retraining process of the ML model, can therein be integrated. Hence, model-based concepts and the implementation are devised to cope with the complexity of iterative data management as an enabler for the integration of continuous retraining routines. With Deep Learning techniques becoming technically feasible and massively being developed further over the last decade, MLOps, aiming to establish DevOps tailored to ML projects, gained crucial relevance. Unfortunately, data-management concepts for iteratively growing datasets with retraining capabilities embedded in a model-driven ML development methodology are unexplored to the best of our knowledge. To fill in this gap, this contribution provides such agile data management concepts and integrates them and continuous retraining into the model-driven ML Framework MontiAnna [18]. The new functionality is evaluated in the context of a research project where ML is exploited for the optimal design of lattice structures for crash applications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

During the last year ChatGPT, a state-of-the-art large language model has received even more attention both in the field of scientific research and in common use by individuals or companies. In this study, we investigate the possibility of adopting ChatGPT as a tool for designing gamification platforms in the Software Engineering domain. Leveraging the capabilities of ChatGPT, we assess how good is it at generating effective suggestions and ideas for designers or developers. To evaluate ChatGPT's potential as a gamification platform creator we narrowed the context to one particular Software Engineering activity, asking for possible aspects of the activity to be gamified. Each proposed aspect was subsequently unraveled by ChatGPT both asking in a shared and separate context, first following the conversational nature of the model, then applying a validated design framework. The study assesses ChatGPT's ability to select and integrate game elements to build a thriving gamification environment by framing the design of the platform to a state-of-the-art conceptual framework. To evaluate the goodness of the design choices made we relied both on the Octalysis framework and on personal experience. The findings of the papers show that ChatGPT can only create simple playful experiences not very effective. Although, by instructing the model with more specific desired mechanics and dynamics, it is possible to guide it toward the application of the ideas suggested. We argue that ChatGPT is not capable of building a gamified environment on its own, but it could still be used to build the foundation of a gamification platform as long as the designers refine and rough out the advice gained from a user-centered solution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Human emotions can be identified across different modalities, such as biosignal, speech, text, and mimics. This paper is focusing on time-continuous prediction of level of valence and psycho-physiological arousal. In that regard, we investigate, (a) the use of different feature embeddings obtained from neural networks pre-trained on different speech tasks (e.g., phone classification, speech emotion recognition) and self-supervised neural networks, (b) estimation of arousal and valence from physiological signals in an end-to-end manner and (c) combining different neural embeddings. Our investigations on the MuSe-Stress sub-challenge shows that (a) the embeddings extracted from physiological signals using CNNs trained in an end-to-end manner improves over the baseline approach of modeling physiological signals, (b) neural embeddings obtained from phone classification neural network and speech emotion recognition neural network trained on auxiliary language data sets yield improvement over baseline systems purely trained on the target data, and (c) task-specific neural embeddings yield improved performance over self-supervised neural embeddings for both arousal and valence. Our best performing system on test-set surpass the DeepSpectrum baseline (combined score) by a relative 7.7% margin                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Among the different educational fields to which gamification has been applied, process modeling is currently not much explored: there are few examples of game-like approaches used for teaching process modeling, and such examples have yet to be applied for the duration of an entire course to assess possible benefits. We thus describe the use of BIPMIN, a platform that implements elements regularly used in gamified tools such as levels, avatars, and leaderboards, in an Information Systems course, where students used the tool to perform practical BPMN modeling exercises over the whole duration of the course to get feedback on their modeling strategies. The students’ opinions have been gathered in the form of an end-of-course questionnaire and have been analyzed following the Straussian grounded theory approach to assess the general sentiment regarding usability, appreciation, and possible issues and improvement areas of the tool. The gathered results are encouraging, as they show that the tool has been well received and that its features that help student understanding the reasons behind their errors have been perceived as helpful for learning and improving BPMN modeling.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

In the last decades, different modelling formalisms have been proposed for supporting software development. However, their adoption and practice strongly rely on mastering essential modelling skills to develop a complete and coherent model-based system. Moreover, it is often difficult for novice modellers to get direct and timely feedback and recommendations on their modelling strategies and decisions, particularly in large classroom settings which hinders their learning. Certainly, there is an opportunity to apply Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to an MDE learning environment to empower the provisioning of automated and intelligent modelling advocacy. In this paper, we propose a framework called ModBud (a modelling buddy) to educate novice modellers about the art of abstraction. ModBud uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to create modelling bots with the aim of improving the modelling skills of novice modellers and assisting other practitioners, too. These bots could be used to support teaching with automatic creation or grading of models and enhance learning beyond the traditional classroom-based MDE education with timely feedback and personalized tutoring. Research challenges for the proposed framework are discussed and a research roadmap is presented.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

The efficacy and quality of deliverables of each phase are skill dependent. In recent times, Generative AI techniques, including Large-scale Language Models (LLMs) like GPT, have become significant players in software engineering. These models, trained on extensive text data, can offer valuable contributions to software development. Interacting with LLMs involves feeding prompts with the context information and guiding the generation of textual responses. The quality of the response is dependent on the quality of the prompt given. This paper proposes a systematic prompting approach based on meta-model concepts for SDLC phases. The approach is validated using ChatGPT for small but complex business application development. We share the approach and our experience, learnings, benefits obtained, and the challenges encountered while applying the approach using ChatGPT. Our experience indicates that Generative AI techniques, such as ChatGPT, have the potential to reduce the skills barrier and accelerate software development substantially.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

They use a variety of recommendation methods,tailored to concrete modelling languages. Typically, recommenders are created as independent programs, and subsequently need to be integrated within a modelling tool, incurring in high development effort. Moreover, it is currently not possible to reuse a recommender created for a modelling language with a different notation, even if they are similar. To attack these problems, we propose a methodology to reuse and integrate recommenders into modelling tools. It considers four orthogonal dimensions: the target modelling language, the tool, the recommendation source, and the recommended items. To make homogeneous the access to arbitrary recommenders, we propose a reference recommendation service that enables indexing recommenders, investigating their properties, and obtaining recommendations likely coming from several sources. Our methodology is supported by IronMan, an Eclipse plugin that automates the integration of recommenders within Sirius and tree-based editors, and can bridge recommenders created for a modelling language for their reuse with a different one. We evaluate the power of the tool by reusing 2 recommenders for 4 different languages, and integrating them into 6 modelling tools.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

They provide an intuitive natural language interface for interaction, available from a wide range of channels including social networks, web pages, intelligent speakers or cars. In response to this demand, many chatbot development platforms and tools have emerged. However, they typically lack support to statically measure properties of the chatbots being built, as indicators of their size, complexity, quality or usability. Similarly, there are hardly any mechanisms to compare and cluster chatbots developed with heterogeneous technologies.To overcome this limitation, we propose a suite of 21 metrics for chatbot designs, as well as two clustering methods that help in grouping chatbots along their conversation topics and design features. Both the metrics and the clustering methods are defined on a neutral chatbot design language, becoming independent of the implementation platform. We provide automatic translations of chatbots defined on some major platforms into this neutral notation to perform the measurement and clustering. The approach is supported by our tool Asymob, which we have used to evaluate the metrics and the clustering methods over a set of 259 Dialogflow and Rasa chatbots from open-source repositories. The results open the door to incorporating the metrics within chatbot development processes for the early detection of quality issues, and to exploit clustering to organise large collections of chatbots into significant groups to ease chatbot comprehension, search and comparison.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

We condense SAL capabilities from prior work and prioritize with business analysts and data engineers via a Kano model, before implementing a prototypical UI. We augment the UI with our conversational engine and propose In-situ Prompt Engineering and learn from Human Feedback to smoothen the interaction and manipulation of UI through natural language commands. To evaluate the efficacy and usability of conversational control in various use-case scenarios, we conduct and report on an empirical interaction design user study. Our findings provide evidence supporting enhanced user engagement and satisfaction. We also observe significant increase of trust in AI after working with our conversational UI. This work generates areas for further refinement and research towards more intelligent, highly-integrated conversational UIs even beyond our application within Semantic Automation. We discuss our findings and point out next steps paving the way for future research and development in creating more intuitive and adaptive user interfaces.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Due to the specialized language in these reports, traditional natural language processing techniques often prove insufficient, making LLMs a better alternative. These models are capable of understanding the complexity and subtlety of the language, allowing for a more nuanced interpretation of the data. We focus our study on the extraction of sentiment scores from these reports, using them to construct and test investment strategies. Given that Korean analyst reports present unique linguistic challenges and a significant ‘buy’ recommendation bias, we employ LLMs fine-tuned for the Korean language and Korean financial texts.

Electronic System-Level (ESL) design using SystemC Transaction Level Modeling (TLM) enables effective performance estimation, design space exploration, and gradual refinement. However, memory contention is often only detectable after detailed TLM-2.0 approximately-timed or cycle-accurate RTL models are developed. A memory bottleneck detected at such a late stage can severely limit the available design choices or even require costly redesign. In this work, we propose a novel TLM-2.0 loosely-timed contention-aware (LT-CA) modeling style that offers high-speed simulation close to traditional loosely-timed (LT) models, yet shows the same accuracy for memory contention as low-level approximately-timed (AT) models. Thus, our proposed LT-CA modeling breaks the speed/accuracy tradeoff between regular LT and AT models and offers fast and accurate observation and visualization of memory contention. Our extensible SystemC model generator automatically produces desired TLM-1 and TLM-2.0 models from a DNN architecture description for design space exploration focusing on memory contention. We demonstrate our approach with a real-world industry-strength DNN application, GoogLeNet. The experimental results show that the proposed LT-CA modeling is 46x faster in simulation than equivalent AT models with an average error of less than 1% in simulated time. Early detection of memory contentions also suggests that local memories close to computing cores can eliminate memory contention in such applications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

A DMFB consists of a two-dimensional electrode array, and it manipulates droplets of liquid to automatically execute biochemical protocols for clinical chemistry. However, a major problem with DMFBs is that electrodes can degrade over time. The transportation of droplet transportation over these degraded electrodes can fail, thereby adversely impacting the integrity of the bioassay outcome. We demonstrated that the formulation of droplet transportation as an RL problem enables the training of deep neural network policies that can adapt to the underlying health conditions of electrodes and ensure reliable fluidic operations. We describe an RL-based droplet routing solution that can be used for various sizes of DMFBs. We highlight the reliable execution of an epigenetic bioassay with the RL droplet router on a fabricated DMFB. We show that the use of the RL approach on a simple micro-computer (Raspberry Pi 4) leads to acceptable performance for time-critical bioassays. We present a simulation environment based on the OpenAI Gym Interface for RL-guided droplet routing problems on DMFBs. We present results on our study of electrode degradation using fabricated DMFBs.

However, the video analytics pipelines with edge-cloud collaboration are complex, involving the decision-making for many coupled control knobs. We propose a deep reinforcement learning-based approach, named ModelIO, for dynamic DNN &lt;u&gt;Model&lt;/u&gt; selection and &lt;u&gt;I&lt;/u&gt;nference &lt;u&gt;O&lt;/u&gt;ffloading for video analytics with edge-cloud collaboration. We jointly consider the decision-making for video pre-processing, DNN model selection, local inference, and offloading in a video analytics system to maximize performances. Our method can learn the optimal control policy for video analytics with the edge-cloud collaboration without complex system modeling. We implement a real-world testbed to conduct the experiments to evaluate the performances of our method. The results show that our method can significantly improve the system processing capacity, reduce average inference delays, and maximize overall rewards.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Now, it is time to reconsider the relationship between ML and systems and let ML transform the way that computer architecture and systems are designed. This embraces a twofold meaning: improvement of designers’ productivity and completion of the virtuous cycle. In this article, we present a comprehensive review of the work that applies ML for computer architecture and system design. First, we perform a high-level taxonomy by considering the typical role that ML techniques take in architecture/system design, i.e., either for fast predictive modeling or as the design methodology. Then, we summarize the common problems in computer architecture/system design that can be solved by ML techniques and the typical ML techniques employed to resolve each of them. In addition to emphasis on computer architecture in a narrow sense, we adopt the concept that data centers can be recognized as warehouse-scale computers; sketchy discussions are provided in adjacent computer systems, such as code generation and compiler; we also give attention to how ML techniques can aid and transform design automation. We further provide a future vision of opportunities and potential directions and envision that applying ML for computer architecture and systems would thrive in the community.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Although many SFUDA works use the pseudo-labeling strategy to improve the accuracy of pseudo-labels in the target domain, these strategies ignore the influence of domain shift on calculating the reference distribution of pseudo-labels. In this article, we propose a novel kind of SFUDA with trusted pseudo samples (SFUDA-TPS), which uses reliable feature reference distribution to solve the SFUDA problem. In SFUDA-TPS, we design a target feature correcting classifier to alleviate the problem of feature reference distribution deviating from target domain samples distribution. On this basis, the more reliable feature reference distribution is calculated by selecting the target domain samples with a high amount of information, i.e., low entropy in the fixed source domain classifier and target feature correcting classifier. The implicit alignment between the source domain and target domain is realized by learning the source domain distributions hidden in the fixed source domain classifier. Experimental evaluations illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in solving SFUDA tasks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Since the practice of domain modelling requires time in addition to modelling skills and experience, several approaches have been proposed to automate or semi-automate the construction of domain models from problem descriptions expressed in NL. Despite the existing work on domain model extraction, some significant challenges remain unaddressed: (i) the extracted domain models are not accurate enough to be used directly or with minor modifications in software development, (ii) existing approaches do not facilitate the tracing of the rationale behind the modelling decisions taken by the model extractor, and (iii) existing approaches do not provide interactive interfaces to update the extracted domain models. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a domain modelling bot called DoMoBOT, explain its architecture, and implement it in the form of a web-based prototype tool. The bot automatically extracts a domain model from a problem description written in NL with an accuracy higher than existing approaches. Furthermore, the bot enables modellers to update a part of the extracted domain model and in response the bot re-configures the other parts of the domain model pro-actively. To improve the accuracy of extracted domain models, we combine the techniques of Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. Finally, we evaluate the accuracy of the extracted domain models.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

A couple of examples are the generation of code excerpts from NL instructions or the verbalization of programs in NL to facilitate their comprehension.Many of these language models have been trained with open source software datasets and therefore "understand" a variety of programming languages, but not OCL.We argue that OCL needs to jump into the machine learning bandwagon or it will risk losing its appeal as a constraint specification language. For that, the key first task is to create together an OCL corpus dataset amenable for natural language processing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

To date, however, concepts have tended to be only implicit in software design with development being organized instead around more concrete artifacts (such as wireframes and code modules). Palantir, a software company whose data analytics products are widely used by major corporations, recently reworked the internal representation of its software development process to bring concepts to the fore, making explicit the concepts underlying its products, including how they are clustered together, used in applications, and governed by teams. With a centralized repository of concepts, Palantir engineers are able to align products more closely based on shared concepts, evolve concepts in response to user needs, and communicate more effectively with non-engineering groups within the company. This paper reports on Palantir's experiences to date, analyzing both successes and challenges, and offers advice to other organizations considering adopting a concept-centric approach to software development.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Possible causes include psychological, biological, and social sources of distress. Clinical depression is the more-severe form of depression, also known as major depression or major depressive disorder. Recently, electroencephalography and speech signals have been used for early diagnosis of depression; however, they focus on moderate or severe depression. We have combined audio spectrogram and multiple frequencies of EEG signals to improve diagnostic performance. To do so, we have fused different levels of speech and EEG features to generate descriptive features and applied vision transformers and various pre-trained networks on the speech and EEG spectrum. We have conducted extensive experiments on Multimodal Open Dataset for Mental-disorder Analysis (MODMA) dataset, which showed significant improvement in performance in depression diagnosis (&lt;bold&gt;0.972&lt;/bold&gt;, &lt;bold&gt;0.973&lt;/bold&gt; and &lt;bold&gt;0.973&lt;/bold&gt; precision, recall and F1 score respectively) for patients at the mild stage. Besides, we provided a web-based framework using Flask and provided the source code publicly.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

With automated domain modelling support using existing approaches, some challenges remain unaddressed - inadequate accuracy of extracted models, no support for traceability of modelling decisions, and no facility for system-modeller interactions. To address these challenges and better support practitioners, we present our bot-assisted solution. Furthermore, we evaluate the effectiveness of our solution and find promising results which warrant further research in this direction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

However, the information obtained through the patient’s review of the past two weeks’ experience is neither timely nor objective. Moreover, while patients have medicine at home, doctors lose the way of monitoring and intervening them on time. In this paper, we propose and implement a web-based longitudinal mental health monitoring system. On the user end, the patients can report their daily information through ecological momentary assessment (EMA), share their emotions in speech or face video, test their depression severity through the PHQ-9 questionnaire table or face videos recorded while going through a semi-structured interview, and check their recent history of activity, sleeping, emotion log, and depression severity etc. The server end implements emotion recognition and depression estimation on the pre-trained deep learning models. On the doctor end, the doctor can manage the information of all the patients under his(her) supervision, monitor their recent status, and edit their depression severity after clinical diagnosis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Existing interpretation techniques include post-hoc methods and interpretable modeling. The former category could quantitatively analyze input contribution to model prediction but has limited interpretation faithfulness, while the latter could explain model internal mechanisms but may not directly attribute model predictions to input features. In this study, we propose a novel Dual Interpretable Recommendation model called DIRECT, which integrates ideas of the two interpretation categories to inherit their advantages and avoid limitations. Specifically, DIRECT makes use of item descriptions as explainable evidence for recommendation. First, similar to the post-hoc interpretation, DIRECT could attribute the prediction of a user preference score to textual words of the item descriptions. The attribution of each word is related to its sentiment polarity and word importance, where a word is important if it corresponds to an item aspect that the user is interested in. Second, to improve the interpretability of embedding space, we propose to extract high-level concepts from embeddings, where each concept corresponds to an item aspect. To learn discriminative concepts, we employ a concept-bottleneck layer, and maximize the coding rate reduction on word-aspect embeddings by leveraging a word-word affinity graph extracted from a pre-trained language model. In this way, DIRECT simultaneously achieves faithful attribution and usable interpretation of embedding space. We also show that DIRECT achieves linear inference time complexity regarding the length of item reviews. We conduct experiments including ablation studies on five real-world datasets. Quantitative analysis, visualizations, and case studies verify the interpretability of DIRECT.

To mitigate large-scale annotations on the target domain, domain adaptation (DA) provides an alternate solution by learning a transferable model from other labeled source domains. Existing multi-source domain adaptation (MDA) methods either fail to extract some discriminative features in the target domain that are related to sentiment, neglect the correlations of different sources and the distribution difference among different sub-domains even in the same source, or cannot reflect the varying optimal weighting during different training stages. In this paper, we propose a novel instance-level MDA framework, named curriculum cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (C-CycleGAN), to address the above issues. Specifically, C-CycleGAN consists of three components: (1) pre-trained text encoder which encodes textual input from different domains into a continuous representation space, (2) intermediate domain generator with curriculum instance-level adaptation which bridges the gap across source and target domains, and (3) task classifier trained on the intermediate domain for final sentiment classification. C-CycleGAN transfers source samples at instance-level to an intermediate domain that is closer to the target domain with sentiment semantics preserved and without losing discriminative features. Further, our dynamic instance-level weighting mechanisms can assign the optimal weights to different source samples in each training stage. We conduct extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and achieve substantial gains over state-of-the-art DA approaches.

| No             |          | Evaluating ChatGPT-4 Vision on Brazil’s National Undergraduate Computer Science Exam                                                                                                                         | The recent integration of visual capabilities into Large Language Models (LLMs) has the potential to play a pivotal role in science and technology education, where visual elements such as diagrams, charts, and tables are commonly used to improve the learning experience. This study investigates the performance of ChatGPT-4 Vision, OpenAI’s most advanced visual model at the time the study was conducted, on the Bachelor in Computer Science section of Brazil’s 2021 National Undergraduate Exam (ENADE). By presenting the model with the exam’s open and multiple-choice questions in their original image format and allowing for reassessment in response to differing answer keys, we were able to evaluate the model’s reasoning and self-reflecting capabilities in a large-scale academic assessment involving textual and visual content. ChatGPT-4 Vision significantly outperformed the average exam participant, positioning itself within the top 10 best score percentile. While it excelled in questions that incorporated visual elements, it also encountered challenges with question interpretation, logical reasoning, and visual acuity. A positive correlation between the model’s performance in multiple-choice questions and the performance distribution of the human participants suggests multimodal LLMs can provide a useful tool for question testing and refinement. However, the involvement of an independent expert panel to review cases of disagreement between the model and the answer key revealed some poorly constructed questions containing vague or ambiguous statements, calling attention to the critical need for improved question design in future exams. Our findings suggest that while ChatGPT-4 Vision shows promise in multimodal academic evaluations, human oversight remains crucial for verifying the model’s accuracy and ensuring the fairness of high-stakes educational exams.

Despite the extensive research in distributed minimax optimization, existing communication efficient solvers that exploit multiple steps of the local update are still not able to generate satisfactory solutions for federated adversarial domain adaptation because of the gradient divergence issue among clients. To tackle this problem, we propose a distributed minimax optimizer, referred to as FedMM, by introducing dual variables to bridge the gradient gap among clients. This algorithm is effective even in the extreme case where each client has different label classes and some clients only have unlabeled data. We prove that FedMM admits benign convergence to a stationary point under domain-shifted unlabeled data. On a variety of benchmark datasets, extensive experiments show that FedMM consistently achieves both better communication savings and significant accuracy improvements over existing federated optimizers based on the stochastic gradient descent ascent (SGDA) algorithm. When training from scratch, for example, it outperforms other SGDA based federated average methods by around 20% in accuracy over the same communication rounds; and it consistently outperforms when training from pre-trained models.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Due to its benefits in gathering rich characteristics for diagnosis and prognosis, radiomics in medical imaging has emerged as a popular research trend that provides vital information about textural and spatial features (specifically tumors/lesions). In this work, the concept of radiomics (both handcrafted and deep-learning based) is investigated for the prognosis of patients with breast cancer, and to determine the course of treatment that can be provided. To achieve this, an open-source package, named Pyradiomics is implemented on RIDER Breast MRI data to extract around 107 hand-crafted radiomics features. Following this, a U-NET-based segmentation model is employed to extract the deep features with four different pre-trained backbone architectures trained on the ImageNet dataset, namely ResNet-50, EfficientNet-B3, Inception-ResNet-V2, and MobileNetV2. Among these, U-NET with ResNet-50 has achieved the highest AUC score of 0.7052, outperforming the rest considered and state-of-the-art techniques.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| No             |          | Enhancing Robust Liver Cancer Diagnosis: A Contrastive Multi-Modality Learner with Lightweight Fusion and Effective Data Augmentation                                                                        | This article explores the application of self-supervised contrastive learning in the medical domain, focusing on classification of multi-modality Magnetic Resonance (MR) images. To address the challenges of limited and hard-to-annotate medical data, we introduce multi-modality data augmentation (MDA) and cross-modality group convolution (CGC). In the pre-training phase, we leverage Simple Siamese networks to maximize the similarity between two augmented MR images from a patient, without a handcrafted pretext task. Our approach also combines 3D and 2D group convolution with a channel shuffle operation to efficiently incorporate different modalities of image features.

However, it can be challenging to capture the inherent structure of the target features accurately due to the lack of supervised information on the target domain. By analyzing the clustering performance of the target features, we show that they still contain core features related to discriminative attributes but lack the collation of semantic information. Inspired by this insight, we present Chaos to Order (CtO), a novel approach for SFDA that strives to constrain semantic credibility and propagate label information among target subpopulations. CtO divides the target data into inner and outlier samples based on the adaptive threshold of the learning state, customizing the learning strategy to fit the data properties best. Specifically, inner samples are utilized for learning intra-class structure thanks to their relatively well-clustered properties. The low-density outlier samples are regularized by input consistency to achieve high accuracy with respect to the ground truth labels. In CtO, by employing different learning strategies to propagate the labels from the inner local to outlier instances, it clusters the global samples from chaos to order. We further adaptively regulate the neighborhood affinity of the inner samples to constrain the local semantic credibility. In theoretical and empirical analyses, we demonstrate that our algorithm not only propagates from inner to outlier but also prevents local clustering from forming spurious clusters. Empirical evidence demonstrates that CtO outperforms the state of the arts on three public benchmarks: Office-31, Office-Home, and VisDA.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Knowledge capture involves the extraction of useful knowledge from vast and diverse data sources as well as its acquisition directly from human experts.Nowadays knowledge is derived from an increasingly diverse set of data resources that differ with regard to their domain, format, quality, coverage, specificity, viewpoint, bias, and most importantly, consumers and producers of data. The heterogeneity, amount and complexity of data allow us to answer complex questions that could not be answered in isolation, requiring the interaction of different scientific fields and technologies. A goal of K-CAP is to develop such synergies using systematic and rigorous methodologies.The call for papers attracted 105 submissions from all over the world, covering a diverse range of topics spanning knowledge mining, large language models for information extraction, neuro-symbolic approaches for knowledge capture, knowledge engineering, question-answering, knowledge graphs, natural language processing, reasoning, entity linking, querying and knowledge-based applications. From a competitive set of high-quality submissions, we accepted 27 long research papers, 5 short papers, and 1 vision paper. The high-quality program is divided into 7 research sessions, in addition to 3 tutorials reflecting novel topics of interest in Knowledge Capture.We encourage everyone to attend the keynote talks that we have planned for K-CAP 2023. The highly anticipated talks by Dr. Robert R. Hoffman (Florida Institute for Human and Machine Cognition) and Dr. Jane Pinelis (Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory) will guide us to a better understanding of the future of knowledge capture and explainable, resilient AI ecosystems, as they become commonplace in real world applications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

There have been many studies that show the usefulness of requirements goal models. However, the establishment of goal models is typically done manually, which is time-consuming and has a steep learning curve. In this paper, we propose a semi-automatic framework for constructing iStar models, which is a well-known goal modeling language. Specifically, we first investigate the practical needs of iStar modelers on the automation of iStar modeling by holding interviews, based on which we propose an interactive and iterative modeling process. Our proposal takes advantage of human decisions and artificial intelligence algorithms, respectively, aiming at achieving low modeling costs while maintaining the quality of models. We then propose a hybrid approach for automatically extracting goal model snippets from requirements text, which implements the automatic tasks of our proposed process. The proposed method combines logical reasoning with deep learning techniques so as to unleash the power of domain knowledge to assist with automation tasks. We have performed a series of experiments for evaluation. The experimental results show that our method achieves the F1-measure of 90.34% for actor entity extraction, 93.14% for intention entity extraction, and 83.18% for actor relation extraction, which can efficiently establish high-quality goal models.

However, in many real-world cross-domain recommendation systems, the source domain and the target domain are sampled from different data distributions, which obstructs the cross-domain knowledge transfer. In this article, we propose to specifically align the data distributions between the source domain and the target domain to alleviate imbalanced sample distribution and thus challenge the data scarcity issue in the target domain. Technically, our proposed approach builds a dual adversarial adaptation (DAA) framework to adversarially train the target model together with a pre-trained source model. Two domain discriminators play the two-player minmax game with the target model and guide the target model to learn reliable domain-invariant features that can be transferred across domains. At the same time, the target model is calibrated to learn domain-specific information of the target domain. In addition, we formulate our approach as a plug-and-play module to boost existing recommendation systems. We apply the proposed method to address the issues of insufficient data and imbalanced sample distribution in real-world Click-through Rate/Conversion Rate predictions on two large-scale industrial datasets. We evaluate the proposed method in scenarios with and without overlapping users/items, and extensive experiments verify that the proposed method is able to significantly improve the prediction performance on the target domain. For instance, our method can boost PLE with a performance improvement of 15.4% in terms of Area Under Curve compared with single-domain PLE on our private game dataset. In addition, our method is able to surpass single-domain MMoE by 6.85% on the public datasets.

Although conventional design automation coupled with IP and platform reuse techniques have led to leaps in design productivity improvement, they face fundamental limits given that most design optimization and verification problems remain NP-hard and that reuse of pre-designed IP blocks and platforms inherently limits flexibility and optimality. At the same time, machine learning (ML) has recently made unprecedented advances and created phenomenal impact in various computing applications. In particular, application of ML techniques as a way to extract knowledge and learn from existing design, optimization and verification data has recently seen a lot of excitement and promise at lower physical and integrated circuit levels of abstraction. Using ML has the potential to similarly close the complexity gap in embedded system design, but corresponding ML-based approaches for embedded system optimization and verification at higher levels of abstraction are still at their infancy.This paper presents the current state of the art, along with opportunities and open challenges, in the application of ML methods for embedded system design and optimization. We discuss design and optimization at different levels of abstraction ranging from system-level modeling and optimization and high-level synthesis to RTL and micro-architecture design, bringing together perspectives from different communities in both academia and industry.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Research competitions have been a long-standing and valuable tradition in the speech and language community. They accelerate the development of new technologies by establishing a shared testbed, cross-validating many potential approaches, and attracting new researchers to the field. DSTC, the Dialog System Technology Challenge, has been a premier research competition for Dialog Systems since its inception in 2013. The earlier Dialog State Tracking Challenges focused on developing a single component for dialog state tracking on goaloriented human-machine conversations. Then, DSTC4 (2015) and DSTC5 (2016) introduced human-human conversations and started to offer multiple tasks not only for dialog state tracking, but also for other components in dialog systems as the pilot tasks. From the sixth challenge (2017), the DSTC has rebranded itself as “Dialog System Technology Challenge” and organized multiple main tracks in parallel to address a wider variety of end-to-end dialog related problems. In line with recent editions of this challenge, DSTC8 focuses on applying end-to-end technologies to Dialog Systems in a pragmatic way. We opened the call for track proposals to the dialog research community and finally held the four parallel main tracks: (1) Multi-domain Task Completion, (2) NOESIS II: Predicting Responses, Identifying Success, and Managing Complexity in Task-Oriented Dialogue, (3) Audio Visual SceneAware Dialog Track, and (4) Scalable Schema-Guided Dialogue State Tracking. This special issue presents more in-depth details of the challenge outcomes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

Modeling the semantic relevance between queries and ads is one of the most crucial factors affecting the performance of CTR prediction. However, different users have different sensitivities to semantic relevance due to their personalized relevance preferences. Therefore, semantic relevance may have different incentives on the user's click probability (i.e., stimulative incentive, inhibitive incentive, or irrelevant incentive). Unfortunately, few works have studied the phenomenon, which ignores the complicated incentive effects of semantic relevance and limits the performance of CTR prediction.To this end, we propose a novel Personalized Relevance Incentive N eTwork (PRINT for short) to explicitly model the personalized incentives of query-ad semantic relevance on user's click probability. Specifically, we introduce a User Relevance Preference Module (usertask) to extract the user's personalized relevance preference from historical query-ad interacted sequence. Then, a RElevance Incentive Module (REIM) is designed to discern three incentive types and model the personalized incentive effects on CTR prediction. Experiments on public datasets and industrial datasets demonstrate the significant improvement of our PRINT. Furthermore, PRINT is also deployed in the sponsored search advertising system in Meituan, obtaining an improvement of 1.94% and 2.29% in CTR and Cost Per Mile (CPM) respectively.

Conventional model-based OPC encounters performance degradation and large process variation, while aggressive approach such as inverse lithography technology (ILT) suffers from large computational overhead for both mask optimization and mask writing processes. In this paper, we developed Neural-ILT, an end-to-end learning-based OPC framework, which literally conducts mask prediction and ILT correction for a given layout in a single neural network, with the objectives of (1) mask printability enhancement, (2) mask complexity optimization and (3) flow acceleration. Quantitative results show that, comparing to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) learning-based OPC solution and conventional ILT flow, Neural-ILT can achieve 30\\texttimes{} ~ 70\\texttimes{} turn around time (TAT) speedup with lower mask complexity and comparable mask printability. We believe this work could arouse the interests of bridging well-developed deep learning toolkits to GPU-based high-performance lithographic computations to achieve groundbreaking performance boosting on various computational lithography-related tasks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

One such manifestation is automatic disease diagnosis, which aims to assist clinicians in conducting symptom investigations and disease diagnoses. When we consult with doctors, we often report and describe our health conditions with visual aids. Moreover, many people are unacquainted with several symptoms and medical terms, such as mouth ulcer and skin growth. Therefore, visual form of symptom reporting is a necessity. Motivated by the efficacy of visual form of symptom reporting, we propose and build a novel end-to-end Multi-modal Disease Diagnosis Virtual Assistant (MDD-VA) using reinforcement learning technique. In conversation, users' responses are heavily influenced by the ongoing dialogue context, and multi-modal responses appear to be of no difference. We also propose and incorporate a Context-aware Symptom Image Identification module that leverages discourse context in addition to the symptom image for identifying symptoms effectively. Furthermore, we first curate a multi-modal conversational medical dialogue corpus in English that is annotated with intent, symptoms, and visual information. The proposed MDD-VA outperforms multiple uni-modal baselines in both automatic and human evaluation, which firmly establishes the critical role of symptom information provided by visuals .

The majority of previous studies of CL estimation used speech collected in laboratory conditions and conventional speech classification methods. Traditionally laboratory speech contains balanced classes that are labeled by a third party after the speech has been collected. In contrast, the speech used in this research was recorded during an experiment focused on human-machine interaction - where spoken commands were used to control simulated aircraft. The speech was labeled using subjective assessments of CL during an experiment that manipulated workload. Current state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classification was used for cognitive load estimation and was compared with conventional Support Vector Machine (SVM) and k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) classification. Different speaker-dependence models were compared across 2 and 3 classes. In addition, class boundary selection was optimized to reflect the subjective human workload response sigmoidal curve and compared with linear class boundaries. Results for 3-class CL estimation showed that CNN classifiers trained using speech spectrograms for Partially Speaker Dependent (PSD) models using sigmoidal curve class boundaries provided up to 83.7% accuracy. CNN classifiers outperformed baseline SVM and k-NN classifiers (that used acoustic features) on the same dataset by 13.2% and 10.5% respectively. These outcomes indicate that spectrogram-trained CNN classifiers are a worthy consideration in paralinguistic classification problems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Most recently, COVID-19 has underlined the importance of simulation studies and limitations in current practices and methods. We identify four goals of methodological work for addressing these limitations. The first is to provide better support for capturing, representing, and evaluating the context of simulation studies, including research questions, assumptions, requirements, and activities contributing to a simulation study. In addition, the composition of simulation models and other simulation studies’ products must be supported beyond syntactical coherence, including aspects of semantics and purpose, enabling their effective reuse. A higher degree of automating simulation studies will contribute to more systematic, standardized simulation studies and their efficiency. Finally, it is essential to invest increased effort into effectively communicating results and the processes involved in simulation studies to enable their use in research and decision-making. These goals are not pursued independently of each other, but they will benefit from and sometimes even rely on advances in other subfields. In the present paper, we explore the basis and interdependencies evident in current research and practice and delineate future research directions based on these considerations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Automating this process allows designers to work with the language in which they are most comfortable - the original natural language - and focus instead on other downstream design challenges. We explore the use of state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) to automatically derive Verilog snippets from English via fine-tuning GPT-2, a natural language ML system. We describe our approach for producing a suitable dataset of novice-level digital design tasks and provide a detailed exploration of GPT-2, finding encouraging translation performance across our task sets (94.8% correct), with the ability to handle both simple and abstract design tasks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

And by applying the text summarization model, the information acquisition efficiency can be effectively improved and the required information can be quickly captured. Most of the current extractive summaries, characterize the sentences in the original document and construct a relationship model between the sentences, and ultimately select multiple sentences with higher scores to form a summary, but this often leads to a model that is more inclined to select highly generalized sentences and ignores the coupling between multiple sentences. So when characterizing the sentences in a document, it is necessary that the characterization vectors can express the semantic information as accurately as possible. In this paper, we propose a SimBERTSUM summarization framework based on contrast learning, which improves the quality of summaries by introducing contrast learning and then effectively learning the feature information of data. The model is also validated using real data, which has a wide range of application prospects and important significance in the field of natural language processing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

In practice, medical data is hard to collect and even harder to annotate, but leveraging multi-modality medical images to make up for small datasets has proved to be helpful. In this work, we focus on mining multi-modality Magnetic Resonance (MR) images to learn multi-modality contrastive representations. We first present multi-modality data augmentation (MDA) to adapt contrastive learning to multi-modality learning. Then, the proposed cross-modality group convolution (CGC) is used for multi-modality features in the downstream fine-tune task. Specifically, in the pre-training stage, considering different behaviors from each MRI modality with the same anatomic structure, yet without designing a handcrafted pretext task, we select two augmented MR images from a patient as a positive pair, and then directly maximize the similarity between positive pairs using Simple Siamese networks. To further exploit multi-modality representation, we combine 3D and 2D group convolution with a channel shuffle operation to efficiently incorporate different modalities of image features. We evaluate our proposed methods on liver MR images collected from a well-known hospital in Taiwan. Experiments show our framework has significantly improved from previous methods.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

However, current methods are largely restricted to single buildings; these methods require energy and occupancy monitoring sensor deployments, which can be expensive and difficult to deploy at scale. Further, current methods for estimating energy consumption and population cannot provide fine enough temporal or spatial granularity for a reasonable personal energy footprint estimate. In this work, we present CityEnergy, a data-driven system for city-wide estimation of personal energy footprints. CityEnergy takes advantage of existing sensing infrastructure and data sources in urban cities to provide energy and population estimates at the building level, even in built environments that do not have existing or accessible energy or population data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| No             |          | A Hybrid Deep Transfer Learning Model With Kernel Metric for COVID-19 Pneumonia Classification Using Chest CT Images                                                                                         | Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) as a new pneumonia which is extremely infectious, the classification of this coronavirus is essential to effectively control the development of the epidemic. Pathological changes in the chest computed tomography (CT) scans are often used as one of the diagnostic criteria of COVID-19. Meanwhile, deep learning-based transfer learning is currently an effective strategy for computer-aided diagnosis (CAD). To further improve the performance of deep transfer learning model used for COVID-19 classification with CT images, in this article, we propose a hybrid model combined with a semi-supervised domain adaption model and extreme learning machine (ELM) classifier, and the application of a novel multikernel correntropy induced loss function in transfer learning is also presented. The proposed model is evaluated on open-source datasets.

Speech fluency prediction, however, can be questioned in a more relaxed social setting, where the ratings arise usually from non-experts; indeed, everyday assessments of fluency are appraised by our social environment and encounters; these encounters due to globalisation are becoming of international nature and therefore being a non-expert has become a norm. This paper explores the latter direction, i.e., prediction of non-expert perceived speech fluency ratings, which has not been studied in the speech technology literature, to the best of our knowledge. Toward that, we investigate several approaches, namely, (a) low-level descriptor feature functionals, (b) bag-of-audio word based approach and (c) neural network based end-to-end acoustic modelling approach. Our investigations on speech data collected from 54 speakers and rated by seven non-experts demonstrate that non-expert speech fluency ratings can be systematically predicted, with the best performing system yielding a Pearson’s correlation coefficient of 0.66 and a Spearman’s correlation coefficient of 0.67 with the median human scores.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| No             |          | Working with Large Code Bases: A Cognitive Apprenticeship Approach to Teaching Software Engineering                                                                                                          | Prior work has highlighted the gap between industry expectations for recent university graduates and the abilities those recent graduates possess. These works have even specifically recommended that students be given the opportunity to work on large, pre-existing code bases in their undergraduate career. This paper presents our experience teaching a newly-created course calledWorking with Large Code Bases. Guided by a Cognitive Apprenticeship approach to provide an authentic classroom experience that emphasizes the implicit processes and techniques involved in real-world software engineering, the course serves as a practical introduction to the skills and workflow involved in navigating and understanding a large code base. The goal of this experience report is to provide the motivation for key course design decisions, an overview of the course content, and a detailed description of key course components. We present student feedback indicating improved confidence in navigating a large code base and course outcomes related to specific tools and techniques students used in the course. Finally, we provide the full set of course materials we used and actionable recommendations for instructors to administer this course at their own institution, even with limited TA support.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

The previous works usually extract the emotion-cause pairs from two perspectives of emotion and cause. However, emotion extraction is more crucial to the ECPE task than cause extraction. Motivated by this analysis, we propose an end-to-end emotion-cause extraction approach oriented toward emotion prediction (EPO-ECPE), aiming to fully exploit the potential of emotion prediction to enhance emotion-cause pair extraction. Considering the strong dependence between emotion prediction and emotion-cause pair extraction, we propose a synchronization mechanism to share their improvement in the training process. That is, the improvement of emotion prediction can facilitate the emotion-cause pair extraction, and then the results of emotion-cause pair extraction can also be used to improve the accuracy of emotion prediction simultaneously. For the emotion-cause pair extraction, we divide it into genuine pair supervision and fake pair supervision, where the genuine pair supervision learns from the pairs with more possibility to be emotion-cause pairs. In contrast, fake pair supervision learns from other pairs. In this way, the emotion-cause pairs can be extracted directly from the genuine pair, thereby reducing the difficulty of extraction. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the 13 compared systems and achieves new state-of-the-art performance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

The current use of physics-based numerical weather prediction (NWP) limits accuracy and resolution due to high computational cost and strict time-to-solution limits.We report that a data-driven deep learning Earth system emulator, FourCastNet, can predict global weather and generate medium-range forecasts five orders-of-magnitude faster than NWP while approaching state-of-the-art accuracy. FourCastNet is optimized and scales efficiently on three supercomputing systems: Selene, Perlmutter, and JUWELS Booster up to 3,808 NVIDIA A100 GPUs, attaining 140.8 petaFLOPS in mixed precision (11.9% of peak at that scale). The time-to-solution for training FourCastNet measured on JUWELS Booster on 3,072 GPUs is 67.4 minutes, resulting in an 80,000 times faster time-to-solution relative to state-of-the-art NWP, in inference.FourCastNet produces accurate instantaneous weather predictions for a week in advance and enables enormous ensembles that could be used to improve predictions of rare weather extremes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

Unfortunately, there is a considerable modality gap between the semantic-related images and texts in terms of data form and semantic expression. How to fully incorporate visual information into texts to enhance the performance of machine translation is one of the critical issues for MNMT. However, the initial visual and textual features are generally extracted with their modality-specific models; Consequently, there is a considerable representation gap between images and texts. Most previous MNMT works prefer only to adopt the feature-level fusion strategies to learn multi-modal representation, while the modality representation gap is often ignored. To this end, this article proposes a progressive multi-modal Transformer (ProMul-Trans) with Modality Difference-Aware (MDA) to address the visual-to-textual fusion problem raised in MNMT. We first employ MDA to capture the modality-consistency information by taking visual and textual representations as inputs in each Transformer layer. Then a layer-level progressive fusion (Layer-ProFusion) strategy is adopted to progressively align visual and textual representations layer-by-layer to enhance machine translation performance. Experiment results on the Multi30 k dataset are conducted, and the results show that the proposed approach outperforms the compared state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on English &lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math notation="LaTeX"&gt;$to$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; German (En &lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math notation="LaTeX"&gt;$to$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; De), English &lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math notation="LaTeX"&gt;$to$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; French (En &lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math notation="LaTeX"&gt;$to$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; Fr) and English &lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math notation="LaTeX"&gt;$to$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; Czech (En &lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math notation="LaTeX"&gt;$to$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; Cs) tasks.

| No             |          | vrAIn: A Deep Learning Approach Tailoring Computing and Radio Resources in Virtualized RANs                                                                                                                  | The virtualization of radio access networks (vRAN) is the last milestone in the NFV revolution. However, the complex dependencies between computing and radio resources make vRAN resource control particularly daunting. We present vrAIn, a dynamic resource controller for vRANs based on deep reinforcement learning. First, we use an autoencoder to project high-dimensional context data (traffic and signal quality patterns) into a latent representation. Then, we use a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm based on an actor-critic neural network structure and a classifier to map (encoded) contexts into resource control decisions. We have implemented vrAIn using an open-source LTE stack over different platforms. Our results show that vrAIn successfully derives appropriate compute and radio control actions irrespective of the platform and context: (i) it provides savings in computational capacity of up to 30% over CPU-unaware methods; (ii) it improves the probability of meeting QoS targets by 25% over static allocation policies using similar CPU resources in average; (iii) upon CPU capacity shortage, it improves throughput performance by 25% over state-of-the-art schemes; and (iv) it performs close to optimal policies resulting from an offline oracle. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that thoroughly studies the computational behavior of vRANs, and the first approach to a model-free solution that does not need to assume any particular vRAN platform or system conditions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

The PRISE process supports the creation of iStar extensions. Problem: Developing new iStar extensions can take time and effort. That can be related to the constructs used, searching for existing extensions, or even associated with PRISE’s process and sub-processes flows. A tool is needed to make this process more interactive, effective, and productive. Solution: This work aims to present PRISEBot, a chatbot capable of extracting knowledge from the PRISE Process, a collection of existing extensions and offering constructors already used in proposed extensions. When dialoguing with the Bot, the user has access to information via a web interface or Telegram App, where they get satisfactory, high-quality answers close to the ones given by human beings quickly, efficiently, and interactively. SI theory: PRISEBot was developed with the idea of Design Theory in mind, using its knowledge base to evaluate the existing and proposed tools for its goal of facilitating iStar extension proposals. Methods: This research has a prescriptive aspect and was evaluated by conducting analyses between the main LLMs available (ChatGPT, Bing.AI, and Bard). Experts in the field empirically estimated the comparison between questions and answers. Results: During our evaluation, we asked 30 questions to each Bot. Bard answered one question correctly, totaling 3.3% assertiveness. ChatGPT could answer only one question effectively, obtaining 3.3% assertiveness. Bing answered four questions correctly, totaling 13.3% assertiveness. PriseBot answered all the questions effectively, totaling 100% assertiveness. Contributions and impact in the IS area: iStar extensions can be related to various domains when applying goal-oriented requirements analyses. Therefore, it is an essential area in Information Systems. This work aimed to develop a chatbot capable of answering iStar extender questions to produce new extensions efficiently. This chatbot can integrate with the PRISE tool and Telegram.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| No             |          | Experimental Analysis of Large-Scale Learnable Vector Storage Compression                                                                                                                                    | Learnable embedding vector is one of the most important applications in machine learning, and is widely used in various database-related domains. However, the high dimensionality of sparse data in recommendation tasks and the huge volume of corpus in retrieval-related tasks lead to a large memory consumption of the embedding table, which poses a great challenge to the training and deployment of models. Recent research has proposed various methods to compress the embeddings at the cost of a slight decrease in model quality or the introduction of other overheads. Nevertheless, the relative performance of these methods remains unclear. Existing experimental comparisons only cover a subset of these methods and focus on limited metrics. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive comparative analysis and experimental evaluation of embedding compression. We introduce a new taxonomy that categorizes these techniques based on their characteristics and methodologies, and further develop a modular benchmarking framework that integrates 14 representative methods. Under a uniform test environment, our benchmark fairly evaluates each approach, presents their strengths and weaknesses under different memory budgets, and recommends the best method based on the use case. In addition to providing useful guidelines, our study also uncovers the limitations of current methods and suggests potential directions for future research.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

The first ICAIL conference was held in 1987 and its 2023 iteration is the first to be held in person again after the Covid-19 pandemic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| No             |          | Phyllis: Physics-Informed Lifelong Reinforcement Learning for Data Center Cooling Control                                                                                                                    | Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown good performance in data center cooling control for improving energy efficiency. The main challenge in deploying the DRL agent to real-world data centers is how to quickly adapt the agent to the ever-changing system with thermal safety compliance. Existing approaches rely on DRL’s native fine-tuning or a learned data-driven dynamics model to assist the adaptation. However, they require long-term unsafe exploration before the agent or the model can capture a new environment. This paper proposes Phyllis, a physics-informed reinforcement learning approach to assist the DRL agent’s lifelong learning under evolving data center environment. Phyllis first identifies a transition model to capture the data hall thermodynamics in the offline stage. When the environment changes in the online stage, Phyllis assists the adaptation by i) supervising safe data collection with the identified transition model, ii) fitting power usage and residual thermal models, iii) pretraining the agent by interacting with these models, and iv) deploying the agent for further fine-tuning. Phyllis uses known physical laws to inform the transition and power models for improving the extrapolation ability to unseen states. Extensive evaluation for two simulated data centers with different system changes shows that Phyllis saves 5.7% to 13.8% energy usage compared with feedback cooling control and adapts to new environments 8x to 10x faster than fine-tuning with at most 0.74°C temperature overshoot.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

It bridges an infrastructure gap between an application target and existing high-fidelity computer-network simulators. The first component of ParaGraph is a high-level graph representation of a parallel program, which a) faithfully represents parallelism and communication, b) can be extracted automatically from a compiler, and c) is “tuned” for use with network simulators. The second is a runtime that can emulate the representation’s dynamic execution for a simulator. User-extensible mechanisms are available for modeling on-node performance and transforming high-level communication into operations that backend simulators understand. Case studies include deep learning workloads that are extracted automatically from programs written in JAX and TensorFlow and interfaced with several event-driven network simulators. These studies show how system designers can use ParaGraph to build flexible end-to-end software-hardware co-design workflows to tweak communication libraries, find future hardware bottlenecks, and validate simulations with traces.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

RefSR involves migrating texture details from the reference (Ref) image to the low-resolution (LR) image based on their corresponding pixel or patch relations. Hence, high-quality matching and feature extraction are crucial. However, most recent RefSR approaches have primarily focused on advanced network architectures to enhance performance, often overlooking the potential of feature matching and extraction. In this paper, we introduce the dense contrastive learning and depth dynamic aggregation network for Reference-based Super-Resolution, namely DDSR, comprising a dense contrastive learning (DCL) network and a depth dynamic aggregation (DDA) module. To further enhance the accuracy of feature matching, we propose a novel DCL network that optimizes the feature space distribution in a dense contrastive manner, resulting in more precise feature matching. In addition, we design a DDA module that extracts features from the Ref image, utilizing variable features with multiple depths to extract feature information comprehensively. Experimental results demonstrate that DDSR outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative measurements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

With the wide applications of deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), learning-based methods have achieved superior performance on MDE tasks in recent years. Because loss functions are important to train an accurate CNN with good generalization performance, nearly all previous efforts contribute to proposing powerful loss functions with careful hand-crafted regularizers(e.g., gradient loss and normal loss) added to the basic depth L1-Loss. However, the hand-crafted regularizers require rich domain knowledge, while their performance can still not be guaranteed. In this paper, we learn a new regularizer, approximated by a tiny CNN Regularizrer-Net(RN), and train it in an adversarial way. As demonstrated experimentally, our learned regularizer can notably outperform the current state-of-the-art methods by both quantitative evaluation and qualitative visualization on the benchmark NYU-Depth-v2 dataset, and well generalize to the new ScanNet dataset without any further training. Our code will be released soon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

To effectively measure the quality of such conversational agents, a model-based automatic dialogue evaluation metric (ADEM) is expected to perform well across multiple domains. Despite significant progress, existing ADEMs tend to perform well only on data that are similar to its training data (overfit to its training domain). This calls for a domain-generalized metric that can assess dialogues of different characteristics. To this end, we propose a &lt;italic&gt;Panel of Experts&lt;/italic&gt; (PoE), a multitask network that consists of a shared transformer encoder and a collection of lightweight adapters. The shared encoder captures the general knowledge of dialogues across domains, while each adapter specializes in one specific domain and serves as a domain expert. To validate the idea, we construct a high-quality multi-domain dialogue dataset leveraging data augmentation and pseudo-labeling. The PoE network is comprehensively assessed on 16 dialogue evaluation datasets spanning a wide range of dialogue domains. It achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of mean Spearman correlation over all the evaluation datasets. It exhibits better zero-shot generalization than existing state-of-the-art ADEMs and the ability to easily adapt to new domains with few-shot transfer learning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Software Language Engineering (SLE) is a thriving research discipline targeted at establishing an engineering approach to the development, use, and maintenance of software languages, that is, of languages for the specification, modeling and tooling of software. Key topics of interest for SLE include approaches, methodologies and tools for language design and implementation with a focus on techniques for static and behavioral semantics, generative or interpretative approaches (including transformation languages and code generation) as well as meta-languages and tools (including language workbenches). Techniques enabling the testing, simulation or formal verification for language validation purposes are also of particular interest. SLE also accommodates empirical evaluation and experience reports of language engineering tools, such as user studies evaluating usability, performance benchmarks or industrial applications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Elasticity is an essential feature for DSP systems, as workload variability calls for automatic scaling of the application processing capacity, to avoid both overload and resource wastage. In this work, we implement auto-scaling in Pulsar Functions, a function-based streaming framework built on top of Apache Pulsar. The latter is is a distributed publish-subscribe messaging platform that natively supports serverless functions. Considering various state-of-the-art policies, we show that the proposed solution is able to scale application parallelism with minimal overhead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Diverse Test Input Generators (TIGs) have been proposed to produce artificial inputs that expose issues of the DL systems by triggering misbehaviours. Unfortunately, such generated inputs may be invalid, i.e., not recognisable as part of the input domain, thus providing an unreliable quality assessment. Automated validators can ease the burden of manually checking the validity of inputs for human testers, although input validity is a concept difficult to formalise and, thus, automate.In this paper, we investigate to what extent TIGs can generate valid inputs, according to both automated and human validators. We conduct a large empirical study, involving 2 different automated validators, 220 human assessors, 5 different TIGs and 3 classification tasks. Our results show that 84% artificially generated inputs are valid, according to automated validators, but their expected label is not always preserved. Automated validators reach a good consensus with humans (78% accuracy), but still have limitations when dealing with feature-rich datasets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

First, a literature review on a basket of eight leading journals was performed. We motivate this study by identifying a lack of studies in the field of MLaaS. The structured literature review was further extended to established scientific databases relevant in this field. We found 30 contributions on MLaaS. As a result of the analysis we grouped them into four key concepts: Platform, Applications; Performance Enhancements and Challenges. Three of the derived concepts are discussed in detail to identify future research areas and to reveal challenges in research as well as in applications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

An emerging solution to address these challenges is to use tailored heterogeneous hardware accelerators combining processing elements of different architectural natures such as Central Processing Unit (CPU), Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), or Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC). To progress towards heterogeneity, a great asset would be an automated design space exploration tool that chooses, for each accelerated partition of a CNN, the most appropriate architecture considering available resources. To feed such a design space exploration process, models are required that provide very fast yet precise evaluations of alternative architectures or alternative forms of CNNs. Quick configuration estimation could be achieved with few parameters from representative input sequences. This article studies a solution called flydeling (as a contraction of flyweight modeling) for obtaining these models by inspiring from the black-box System Identification (SI) domain. We refer to models derived using the proposed approach as flyweight models (flydels).A methodology is proposed to generate these flydels, using CNN properties as predictor features together with SI techniques with a stochastic excitation input at a feature map dimensions level. For an embedded CPU-FPGA-GPU heterogeneous platform, it is demonstrated that it is possible to learn these Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) flydels at an early design stage and from high-level application features. For latency, energy, and resource utilization, flydels obtain estimation errors varying between 5% and 10% with less model parameters compared to state-of-the-art solutions and are built automatically from platform measurements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

However, current adaptive approaches are oblivious to implicit phases that arise from operating on irregular data, such as sparse linear algebra operations. Implicit phases are short-lived and do not exhibit consistent behavior throughout execution. This calls for a high-accuracy, low overhead runtime mechanism for adaptation at a fine granularity. Moreover, adopting such techniques for reconfigurable manycore hardware, such as coarse-grained reconfigurable architectures (CGRAs), adds complexity due to synchronization and resource contention. We propose a lightweight machine learning-based adaptive framework called SparseAdapt. It enables low-overhead control of configuration parameters to tailor the hardware to both implicit (data-driven) and explicit (code-driven) phase changes. SparseAdapt is implemented within the runtime of a recently-proposed CGRA called Transmuter, which has been shown to deliver high performance for irregular sparse operations. SparseAdapt can adapt configuration parameters such as resource sharing, cache capacities, prefetcher aggressiveness, and dynamic voltage-frequency scaling (DVFS). Moreover, it can operate under the constraints of either (i) high energy-efficiency (maximal GFLOPS/W), or (ii) high power-performance (maximal GFLOPS3/W). We evaluate SparseAdapt with sparse matrix-matrix and matrix-vector multiplication (SpMSpM and SpMSpV) routines across a suite of uniform random, power-law and real-world matrices, in addition to end-to-end evaluation on two graph algorithms. SparseAdapt achieves similar performance on SpMSpM as the largest static configuration, with 5.3\\texttimes{} better energy-efficiency. Furthermore, on both performance and efficiency, SparseAdapt is at most within 13% of an Oracle that adapts the configuration of each phase with global knowledge of the entire program execution. Finally, SparseAdapt is able to outperform the state-of-the-art approach for runtime reconfiguration by up to 2.9\\texttimes{} in terms of energy-efficiency.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

This article presents to software engineering researchers the six key challenges that a domain expert faces in addressing their problem with a computational workflow, and the underlying executable implementation. These challenges arise out of our conceptual framework which presents the “route” of transformations that a domain expert may choose to take while developing their solution.To ground our conceptual framework in the state of the practice, this article discusses a selection of available textual and graphical workflow systems and their support for the transformations described in our framework. Example studies from the literature in various domains are also examined to highlight the tools used by the domain experts as well as a classification of the domain specificity and machine learning usage of their problem, workflow, and implementation.The state of the practice informs our discussion of the six key challenges, where we identify which challenges and transformations are not sufficiently addressed by available tools. We also suggest possible research directions for software engineering researchers to increase the automation of these tools and disseminate best-practice techniques between software engineering and various scientific domains.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Towards Knowledge Infused Multi-modal Clinical Conversation Summarization                                                                   | With the advancement of telemedicine, both researchers and medical practitioners are working hand-in-hand to develop various techniques to automate various medical operations, such as diagnosis report generation. In this paper, we first present a multi-modal clinical conversation summary generation task that takes a clinician-patient interaction (both textual and visual information) and generates a succinct synopsis of the conversation. We propose a knowledge-infused, multi-modal, multi-tasking medical domain identification and clinical conversation summary generation (MM-CliConSummation) framework. It leverages an adapter to infuse knowledge and visual features and unify the fused feature vector using a gated mechanism. Furthermore, we developed a multi-modal, multi-intent clinical conversation summarization corpus annotated with intent, symptom, and summary. The extensive set of experiments, both quantitatively and qualitatively, led to the following findings: (a) critical significance of visuals, (b) more precise and medical entity preserving summary with additional knowledge infusion, and (c) a correlation between medical department identification and clinical synopsis generation. Furthermore, the dataset and source code are available at https://github.com/NLP-RL/MM-CliConSummation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| No             |          | Physical Equation Discovery Using Physics-Consistent Neural Network (PCNN) Under Incomplete Observability                                                                                                    | Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been extensively applied to various fields, including physical-system monitoring and control. However, the requirement of a high confidence level in physical systems made system operators hard to trust black-box type DNNs. For example, while DNN can perform well at both training data and testing data, but when the physical system changes its operation points at a completely different range, never appeared in the history records, DNN can fail. To open the black box as much as possible, we propose a Physics-Consistent Neural Network (PCNN) for physical systems with the following properties: (1) PCNN can be shrunk to physical equations for sub-areas with full observability, (2) PCNN reduces unobservable areas into some virtual nodes, leading to a reduced network. Thus, for such a network, PCNN can also represent its underlying physical equation via a specifically designed deep-shallow hierarchy, and (3) PCNN is theoretically proved that the shallow NN in the PCNN is convex with respect to physical variables, leading to a set of convex optimizations to seek for the physics-consistent initial guess for the PCNN. We also develop a physical rule-based approach for initial guesses, significantly shortening the searching time for large systems. Comprehensive experiments on diversified systems are implemented to illustrate the outstanding performance of our PCNN.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Early advances in domain adaptation focus on invariant representations learning (IRL) methods to align domain distributions. Recent studies further utilize semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods to regularize domain-invariant representations based on the cluster assumption, making the category boundary more clear. However, the misalignment in the IRL methods might be intensified by SSL methods if the target instances are more proximate to the wrong source centroid, resulting in incompatibility between these techniques. In this paper, we hypothesize this phenomenon derives from the distraction of the source domain, and further give a novel two-stage adaptation framework to adapt the model toward the target domain. In addition, we propose DCAN to reduce the misalignment in IRL methods in the first stage, and we propose PCST to encode the semantic structure of unlabeled target data in the second stage. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on four benchmarks (Office-31, ImageCLEF-DA, Office-Home, and VisDA-2017).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Specifically, we propose a new accelerated zeroth-order momentum (Acc-ZOM) method for black-box mini-optimization where only function values can be obtained. Moreover, we prove that our Acc-ZOM method achieves a lower query complexity of \\~{O}(d3/4ε-3) for finding an ε-stationary point, which improves the best known result by a factor of O(d1/4) where d denotes the variable dimension. In particular, our Acc-ZOM does not need large batches required in the existing zeroth-order stochastic algorithms. Meanwhile, we propose an accelerated zeroth-order momentum descent ascent (Acc-ZOMDA) method for black-box minimax optimization, where only function values can be obtained. Our Acc-ZOMDA obtains a low query complexity of \\~{O}((d1+d2)3/4κ4.5yε-3) without requiring large batches for finding an ε-stationary point, where d1 and d2 denote variable dimensions and κy is condition number. Moreover, we propose an accelerated first-order momentum descent ascent (Acc-MDA) method for minimax optimization, whose explicit gradients are accessible. Our Acc-MDA achieves a low gradient complexity of \\~{O}(κ4.5yε-3) without requiring large batches for finding an ε-stationary point. In particular, our Acc-MDA can obtain a lower gradient complexity of \\~{O}(κ2.5yε-3) with a batch size O(κ4y), which improves the best known result by a factor of O(κ1/2y).

Our work is motivated by the lack of timely resources (e.g., medical knowledge, annotated data) during the initial phases of an emergent health event or topic. In this paper, we develop a multi-source domain adaptive framework that jointly exploits medical knowledge and annotated data from different high-resource source domains (e.g., cancer, COVID-19) to detect misleading posts in an emergent target domain (e.g., mpox, polio). Two important challenges exist in developing our solution: 1) how to accurately detect the partially misleading and unverifiable content in an emergent target domain? 2) How to identify the conflicting knowledge facts from different source domains to accurately detect emergent misinformation in the target domain? To address these challenges, we develop MMAdapt, a multi-source multi-class domain adaptive misinformation detection framework that effectively explores diverse knowledge facts from different source domains to accurately detect not only the outright misleading but also the partially misleading or unverifiable posts on the Web. Extensive experimental results on four real-world misinformation datasets demonstrate that MMAdapt substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in accurately detecting misinformation in an emergent health domain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

The Hyderabad edition is only the second in this promising series. The long hiatus due to Covid-19 pushed this conference by two years, but we are glad that it is finally here!This edition of ACM CompEd partly overlaps with COMPUTE 2023, ACM India's flagship conference on Computing Education. Having the two conferences adjacent to each other is a great way to build synergy between the Indian computing education community and the global community of computing education researchers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Among these applications, cross-modal interaction and complementary information from different modalities are crucial for advanced models to perform any multimodal task, e.g., understand, recognize, retrieve, or generate optimally. Researchers have proposed diverse methods to address these tasks. The different variants of transformer-based architectures performed extraordinarily on multiple modalities. This survey presents the comprehensive literature on the evolution and enhancement of deep learning multimodal architectures to deal with textual, visual and audio features for diverse cross-modal and modern multimodal tasks. This study summarizes the (i)&nbsp;recent task-specific deep learning methodologies, (ii)&nbsp;the pretraining types and multimodal pretraining objectives, (iii)&nbsp;from state-of-the-art pretrained multimodal approaches to unifying architectures, and (iv)&nbsp;multimodal task categories and possible future improvements that can be devised for better multimodal learning. Moreover, we prepare a dataset section for new researchers that covers most of the benchmarks for pretraining and finetuning. Finally, major challenges, gaps, and potential research topics are explored.

These efforts are however dedicated to achieving an optimal trade-off between accuracy and robustness on a given or seen target domain but ignore the robust generalization issue over unseen adversarial data. Consequently, degraded performance will be often observed when existing robust UDAs are applied to future adversarial data. In this work, we make a first attempt to address the robust generalization issue of UDA. We conjecture that the poor robust generalization of present robust UDAs may be caused by the large distribution gap among adversarial examples. We then provide an empirical and theoretical analysis showing that this large distribution gap is mainly owing to the discrepancy between feature-shift distributions. To reduce such discrepancy, a novel Anchored Feature-Shift Regularization (AFSR) method is designed with a certificated robust generalization bound. We conduct a series of experiments on benchmark UDA datasets. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposed AFSR over many existing robust UDA methods.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Recently, model cards, a proposal for model documentation, have attracted notable attention, but their impact on the actual practice is unclear. In this work, we systematically study the model documentation in the field and investigate how to encourage more responsible and accountable documentation practice. Our analysis of publicly available model cards reveals a substantial gap between the proposal and the practice. We then design a tool named DocML aiming to (1) nudge the data scientists to comply with the model cards proposal during the model development, especially the sections related to ethics, and (2) assess and manage the documentation quality.

This code that introduces instability in the software projects is known as Technical Debt (TD). Often, TD intentionally manifests in source code, which is known as Self-Admitted Technical Debt (SATD). This paper presents DebtHunter, a natural language processing (NLP)- and machine learning (ML)- based approach for identifying and classifying SATD in source code comments. The proposed classification approach combines two classification phases for differentiating between the multiple debt types. Evaluations over 10 open source systems, containing more than 259k comments, showed that the approach was able to improve the performance of others in the literature. The presented approach is supported by a tool that can help developers to effectively manage SATD. The tool complements the analysis over Java source code by allowing developers to also examine the associated issue tracker. DebtHunter can be used in a continuous evolution environment to monitor the development process and make developers aware of how and where SATD is introduced, thus helping them to manage and resolve it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

This includes networked embedded and cyber-physical systems as well as edge computing in mobile applications and the Internet of Things (IoT). In such resource-constrained Networks-of-Systems (NoS), computation and communication workloads need to be carefully co-optimized yet are tightly coupled. How to optimally partition and schedule application tasks among an appropriately designed NoS architecture requires a simultaneous consideration of design parameters from applications and processing platforms all the way to network configurations. Traditionally, however, systems and networks are designed in isolation and combined in an ad hoc manner, which ignores joint effects and optimization opportunities. To systematically explore and optimize NoS design spaces, a higher level of design abstraction on top of traditional system and network design is required.In this article, we propose a novel network-level design methodology for resource-constrained NoS optimization and design space exploration. A key component in such a design flow is fast yet accurate network/system co-simulation to rapidly evaluate NoS parameters with high fidelity. We first introduce a novel NoS simulator (NoSSim) that integrates source-level simulation models of applications with a host-compiled system simulation platform and a reconfigurable network simulation backplane to accurately capture system and network interactions. The co-simulation platform is further combined with model generation tools and a multi-objective genetic search algorithm to provide a comprehensive and fully automated NoS design space exploration framework. Finally, we apply our network-level design flow on several state-of-art IoT/mobile design case studies. Results show that NoSSim can achieve more than 86% simulation accuracy on average as compared to a real-world edge device cluster, where sensitivities to various design parameters are faithfully captured with high fidelity. When applying our network-level design space exploration methodology, design decisions are automatically optimized, where non-obvious NoS configurations are discovered outperforming manually designed solutions by more than 45%.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Our framework consists of multiple components. First, a novel initial UAVs placement algorithm (adapting a known Brain-Storming Optimization algorithm to our setting); second, a novel coalition structure generation protocol that allows for the “online” calculation of coalition values that will eventually guide the rescue effort; and third, a simple but effective opinion aggregation protocol, that can be used to prioritize certain rescue operations in the event of “ambiguous” findings. Moreover, for the recognition task itself we employ two image recognition algorithms, used for the first time for the analysis of post-avalanche Search &amp; Rescue Operations images. Our experimental evaluation verifies the applicability and effectiveness of our framework and its individual components.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Therefore overpopulation of strays needs to be controlled. Strategies to control overpopulation include sterilizing, euthanizing and adopting the strays. The ethical and popular method of acquisition in controlling strays is adoption. Adoptions are mostly carried out by animal shelters. The increase in usage of internet has provided platforms for shelters to advertise adoptions online by sharing pictures. Although there have been past researches on analyzing photo traits affecting the adoption speed, yet simpler improvements are required to guide shelters in posting influential photos. Hence it is essential to use an automated approach to guide shelters in posting influential photos to increase adoption speed. This paper presents the analysis of photo traits affecting adoption speed and computerized automated approaches of image classification. The classification approaches will be reviewed and used in designing an application of the ongoing research to predict the adoption speed of an input animal's image.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

With this consumption comes a large amount of environmental, economic, and social incentive to make turf irrigation systems as efficient as possible. Recent work introduced the concept of distributed control in irrigation systems, but existing control strategies either do not take advantage of the distributed control, or do not revise the strategy over time in response to collected data. In this work, we introduce OPTICS, a data-driven control strategy that self-improves over time, adapts to the local specific conditions and weather changes, and requires virtually no human input in both setup and maintenance providing a plug-and-play system that requires minimal pre-deployment efforts. In addition to substantial improvements in ease-of-use, we find across 4 weeks of large-scale irrigation system deployment that OPTICS improves system efficiency by 12.0% in comparison to industry best and 3.3% in comparison to academic state of the art. Despite using less water, OPTICS also was found to improve quality of service by a factor of 4.0\\texttimes{} compared to industry best and 2.5\\texttimes{} compared to academic state of the art.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Traditionally this is accomplished by extending the IoT system (managed system) with a managing system responsible for handling the adaptation. Many different approaches have been proposed in the literature to perform such adaptations but, they mainly focus on improving the adaptation logic inside the managing system to provide better guarantees on the QoS of the managed system. However, they do not focus on the implementation architecture of the managing system itself. Further, the choice of implementation can impact the QoS offered by the IoT system and that of the managing system. To this end, in this work, we propose a framework that allows the architect to systematically design, analyze and evaluate different architectural strategies for implementing the managing system of self-adaptive IoT systems. The evaluation results of our approach on the case study of a real-world IoT system demonstrate promising results in allowing architects to evaluate multiple architectural strategies for implementing the managing system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

However, we notice that the performance of existing SFDA methods would be dramatically degraded by intra-domain class imbalance and inter-domain label shift. Unfortunately, class-imbalance is a common phenomenon in real-world domain adaptation applications. To address this issue, we present Imbalanced Source-free Domain Adaptation (ISFDA) in this paper. Specifically, we first train a uniformed model from the source domain, and then propose secondary label correction, curriculum sampling, plus intra-class tightening and inter-class separation to overcome the joint presence of covariate shift and label shift. Extensive experiments on three imbalanced benchmarks verify that ISFDA could perform favorably against existing UDA and SFDA methods under various conditions of class-imbalance, and outperform existing SFDA methods by over 15% in terms of per-class average accuracy on a large-scale long-tailed imbalanced dataset.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Existing approaches tend to reduce the distribution discrepancy between the source and target domains or assign the pseudo target labels to implement a self-training strategy. However, the transferability or discriminability lackage of the traditional methods results in the limited ability to generalize on the target domain. To remedy this issue, a novel unsupervised domain adaptation framework called Domain-specific Conditional Jigsaw Adaptation Network (DCJAN) is proposed for UDA, which simultaneously encourages the network to extract transferable and discriminative features. To improve the discriminability, a conditional jigsaw module is presented to reconstruct class-aware features of the original images by reconstructing that of corresponding shuffled images. Moreover, in order to enhance the transferability, a domain-specific jigsaw adaptation is proposed to deal with the domain gaps, which utilizes the prior knowledge of jigsaw puzzles to reduce mismatching. It trains conditional jigsaw modules for each domain and updates the shared feature extractor to make the domain-specific conditional jigsaw modules could perform well not only on the corresponding domain but also on the other domain. A consistent conditioning strategy is proposed to ensure the safe training of conditional jigsaw. Experiments conducted on the widely-used Office-31, Office-Home, VisDA-2017, and DomainNet datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, which outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

We propose a weakly supervised method--adversarial label learning--that trains classifiers to perform well when noisy and possibly correlated labels are provided. Our framework allows users to provide different weak labels and multiple constraints on these labels. Our model then attempts to learn parameters for the data by solving a zero-sum game for the binary problems and a non-zero sum game optimization for multi-class problems. The game is between an adversary that chooses labels for the data and a model that minimizes the error made by the adversarial labels. The weak supervision constrains what labels the adversary can choose. The method therefore minimizes an upper bound of the classifier's error rate using projected primal-dual subgradient descent. Minimizing this bound protects against bias and dependencies in the weak supervision. We first show the performance of our framework on binary classification tasks then we extend our algorithm to show its performance on multiclass datasets. Our experiments show that our method can train without labels and outperforms other approaches for weakly supervised learning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

However, verifying safety of such controllers, which are often hard-to-analyze neural networks, remains a challenge. Inspired by compositional strategies for program verification, we propose a framework for compositional learning and verification of neural network controllers. Our approach is to decompose the task (e.g., car navigation) into a sequence of subtasks (e.g., segments of the track), each corresponding to a different mode of the system (e.g., go straight or turn). Then, we learn a separate controller for each mode, and verify correctness by proving that (i) each controller is correct within its mode, and (ii) transitions between modes are correct. This compositional strategy not only improves scalability of both learning and verification, but also enables our approach to verify correctness for arbitrary compositions of the subtasks. To handle partial observability (e.g., LiDAR), we additionally learn and verify a mode predictor that predicts which controller to use. Finally, our framework also incorporates an algorithm that, given a set of controllers, automatically synthesizes the pre- and postconditions required by our verification procedure. We validate our approach in a case study on a simulation model of the F1/10 autonomous car, a system that poses challenges for existing verification tools due to both its reliance on LiDAR observations, as well as the need to prove safety for complex track geometries. We leverage our framework to learn and verify a controller that safely completes any track consisting of an arbitrary sequence of five kinds of track segments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| No             |          | Towards Motivational and Empathetic Response Generation in Online Mental Health Support                                                                                                                      | The scarcity of Mental Health Professionals (MHPs) available to assist patients underlines the need for developing automated systems to help MHPs combat the grievous mental illness called Major Depressive Disorder. In this paper, we develop a Virtual Assistant (VA) that serves as a first point of contact for users who are depressed or disheartened. In support based conversations, two primary components have been identified to produce positive outcomes,empathy andmotivation. While empathy necessitates acknowledging the feelings of the users with a desire to help, imparting hope and motivation uplifts the spirit of support seekers in distress. A combination of these aspects will ensure generalized positive outcome and beneficial alliance in mental health support. The VA, thus, should be capable of generating empathetic and motivational responses, continuously demonstrating positive sentiment by the VA. The end-to-end system employs two mechanisms in a pipe-lined manner : (i)Motivational Response Generator (MRG) : a sentiment driven Reinforcement Learning (RL) based motivational response generator; and (ii)Empathetic Rewriting Framework (ERF) : a transformer based model that rewrites the response from MRG to induce empathy. Experimental results indicate that our proposed VA outperforms several of its counterparts.

Analyzing the correlations between each brain functional segment in isolation comes from global information missing from building brain networks. Therefore, this paper builds a brain function network based on five common EEG bands, introduces a graph attention network to extract the global information of the depression brain network, recalculates the correlation between brain function nodes, and extracts more refined brain functions Connect the information, and build an autonomous encoder to reduce the dimensionality and feature enhancement of the sparse brain functional connection matrix, reduce a small number of residual information, and fuse the brain networks of the five video bands to obtain the brain functional connection features and brain features that include all video band features.

In the meantime, deep learning techniques have promoted the development of computational methods to interpret large-scale proteomic data and facilitate functional studies of proteins. Inferring properties from protein amino acid sequences has been a long-standing problem in Bioinformatics. Extensive studies have successfully applied natural language processing (NLP) techniques for the representation learning of protein sequences. In this paper, we applied the deep sequence model - UDSMProt, to fine-tune and evaluate two protein prediction tasks: (1) predict proteins with liquid-liquid phase separation propensity and (2) predict synaptic proteins. Our results have shown that, without prior domain knowledge and only based on protein sequences, the fine-tuned language models achieved high classification accuracies and outperformed baseline models using compositional k-mer features in both tasks. Hence, it is promising to apply the protein language model to some learning tasks and the fine-tuned models can be used to predict protein candidates for biological studies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Existing methods mainly extract the text information from only one sentence to represent an image and the text representation effects the quality of the generated image well. However, directly utilizing the limited information in one sentence misses some key attribute descriptions, which are the crucial factors to describe an image accurately. To alleviate the above problem, we propose an effective text representation method with the complements of attribute information. Firstly, we construct an attribute memory to jointly control the text-to-image generation with sentence input. Secondly, we explore two update mechanisms, sample-aware and sample-joint mechanisms, to dynamically optimize a generalized attribute memory. Furthermore, we design an attribute-sentence-joint conditional generator learning scheme to align the feature embeddings among multiple representations, which promotes the cross-modal network training. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed method obtains substantial performance improvements on both the CUB (FID from 14.81 to 8.57) and COCO (FID from 21.42 to 12.39) datasets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

However, performing lifelong learning is non-trivial for deep neural networks as continually training of incrementally available information inevitably results in catastrophic forgetting or interference. In this paper, we propose a novel i terative network p runing with uncertainty r egularization method for l ifelong s entiment classification (IPRLS), which leverages the principles of network pruning and weight regularization. By performing network pruning with uncertainty regularization in an iterative manner, IPRLS can adapt a single BERT model to work with continuously arriving data from multiple domains while avoiding catastrophic forgetting and interference. Specifically, we leverage an iterative pruning method to remove redundant parameters in large deep networks so that the freed-up space can then be employed to learn new tasks, tackling the catastrophic forgetting problem. Instead of keeping the old-tasks fixed when learning new tasks, we also use an uncertainty regularization based on the Bayesian online learning framework to constrain the update of old tasks weights in BERT, which enables positive backward transfer, i.e. learning new tasks improves performance on past tasks while protecting old knowledge from being lost. In addition, we propose a task-specific low-dimensional residual function in parallel to each layer of BERT, which makes IPRLS less prone to losing the knowledge saved in the base BERT network when learning a new task. Extensive experiments on 16 popular review corpora demonstrate that the proposed IPRLS method significantly outperforms the strong baselines for lifelong sentiment classification.

At the same time, the test data should be independent and identically distributed with the training data. However, in practice, a large number of text types make it difficult to satisfy the i.i.d condition between the training set and the test set, which leads to the problem of domain mismatch and significantly reduces the detection performance. In this paper, we draw on the ideas of domain adaptation and transductive learning to design a novel text steganalysis method. In this method, we design a distributed adaptation layer and adopt three loss functions to achieve domain adaptation, so that the model can learn the domain-invariant text features. The experimental results show that the method has better steganalysis performance in the case of domain mismatch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

In image recognition applications, high levels of input locality and redundancy present in CNNs have become the golden goose for skipping costly arithmetic operations. One promising technique for this consists in storing function responses of some input patterns into offline lookup tables and replacing online computation with search operations, which are highly efficient when implemented by emerging non-volatile memory technologies. In this work, we rethink both algorithm and architecture for exploiting locality and reuse opportunities by replacing entire convolutions with searches on Content-addressable Memories. By previously calculating convolution results and building compact lookup tables with our novel clustering algorithm, one can evaluate activations at constant time complexity, also requiring a single read operation of the current input tensor. Then, we devise a reconfigurable array of processing elements based on memristive Ternary Content-addressable Memories to efficiently implement the algorithmic solution and meet the flexibility requirements of several CNN architectures. Results show that our design reduces the number of multiplications and memory accesses proportionally to the number of convolutional layer channels. The average performance is 1,172 and 82 FPS for AlexNet and VGG-16 models, thus outperforming state-of-the-art works by 13\\texttimes{}.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

While open-domain chatbots – like ChatGPT – can converse on any topic, task-oriented chatbots – the focus of this paper – are designed for specific tasks, like booking a flight, obtaining customer support, or setting an appointment. Like any other software, task-oriented chatbots need to be properly tested, usually by defining and executing test scenarios (i.e., sequences of user-chatbot interactions). However, there is currently a lack of methods to quantify the completeness and strength of such test scenarios, which can lead to low-quality tests, and hence to buggy chatbots. To fill this gap, we propose adapting mutation testing (MuT) for task-oriented chatbots. To this end, we introduce a set of mutation operators that emulate faults in chatbot designs, an architecture that enables MuT on chatbots built using heterogeneous technologies, and a practical realisation as an Eclipse plugin. Moreover, we evaluate the applicability, effectiveness and efficiency of our approach on open-source chatbots, with promising results.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| No             |          | DepressionNet: Learning Multi-modalities with User Post Summarization for Depression Detection on Social Media                                                                                               | Twitter is currently a popular online social media platform which allows users to share their user-generated content. This publicly-generated user data is also crucial to healthcare technologies because the discovered patterns would hugely benefit them in several ways. One of the applications is in automatically discovering mental health problems, e.g., depression. Previous studies to automatically detect a depressed user on online social media have largely relied upon the user behaviour and their linguistic patterns including user's social interactions. The downside is that these models are trained on several irrelevant content which might not be crucial towards detecting a depressed user. Besides, these content have a negative impact on the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the model. To overcome the shortcomings in the existing automatic depression detection methods, we propose a novel computational framework for automatic depression detection that initially selects relevant content through a hybrid extractive and abstractive summarization strategy on the sequence of all user tweets leading to a more fine-grained and relevant content. The content then goes to our novel deep learning framework comprising of a unified learning machinery comprising of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) coupled with attention-enhanced Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) models leading to better empirical performance than existing strong baselines.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

The high resource demand of speech emotion recognition models, combined with the general scarcity of emotion-labelled data are obstacles to the development and application of effective solutions in this field. In this paper, we present an approach to jointly circumvent these difficulties. Our method, named RH-emo, is a novel semi-supervised architecture aimed at extracting quaternion embeddings from real-valued monoaural spectrograms, enabling the use of quaternion-valued networks for speech emotion recognition tasks. RH-emo is a hybrid real/quaternion autoencoder network that consists of a real-valued encoder in parallel to a real-valued emotion classifier and a quaternion-valued decoder. On the one hand, the classifier permits to optimization of each latent axis of the embeddings for the classification of a specific emotion-related characteristic: valence, arousal, dominance, and overall emotion. On the other hand, quaternion reconstruction enables the latent dimension to develop intra-channel correlations that are required for an effective representation as a quaternion entity. We test our approach on speech emotion recognition tasks using four popular datasets: IEMOCAP, RAVDESS, EmoDB, and TESS, comparing the performance of three well-established real-valued CNN architectures (AlexNet, ResNet-50, VGG) and their quaternion-valued equivalent fed with the embeddings created with RH-emo. We obtain a consistent improvement in the test accuracy for all datasets, while drastically reducing the resources' demand of models. Moreover, we performed additional experiments and ablation studies that confirm the effectiveness of our approach.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

To further evaluate the quality of pronunciation, multi-task learning with simultaneous output of multi-granularity and multi-aspect has become a mainstream solution. Existing methods either predict scores at all granularity levels simultaneously through a parallel structure, or predict individual granularity scores layer by layer through a hierarchical structure. However, these methods do not fully understand and take advantage of the correlation between the three granularity levels of phoneme, word, and utterance. To address this issue, we propose a novel method, Granularity-decoupled Transformer (Gradformer), which is able to model the relationships between multiple granularity levels. Specifically, we first use a convolution-augmented transformer encoder to encode acoustic features, where the convolution module helps the model better capture local information. The model outputs both phoneme- and word-level granularity scores with high correlation by the encoder. Then, we use utterance queries to interact with the output of the encoder through the transformer decoder, ultimately obtaining the utterance scores. Through unique encoder and decoder architecture, we achieve decoupling at three granularity levels, and handling the relationship between each granularity. Experiments on the speachocean762 dataset show that our model has advantages over state-of-the-art methods in various metrics, especially in key metrics such as phoneme accuracy, word accuracy, and total score.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

CRSs typically provide recommendations through relatively straightforward interactions, where the system continuously inquires about a user's explicit attribute-aware preferences and then decides which items to recommend. In addition, topic tracking is often used to provide naturally sounding responses. However, merely tracking topics is not enough to recognize a user's real preferences in a dialogue.In this paper, we address the problem of accurately recognizing and maintaining user preferences in CRSs. Three challenges come with this problem: (1) An ongoing dialogue only provides the user's short-term feedback; (2) Annotations of user preferences are not available; and (3) There may be complex semantic correlations among items that feature in a dialogue. We tackle these challenges by proposing an end-to-end variational reasoning approach to the task of conversational recommendation. We model both long-term preferences and short-term preferences as latent variables with topical priors for explicit long-term and short-term preference exploration, respectively. We use an efficient stochastic gradient variational Bayesian (SGVB) estimator for optimizing the derived evidence lower bound. A policy network is then used to predict topics for a clarification utterance or items for a recommendation response. The use of explicit sequences of preferences with multi-hop reasoning in a heterogeneous knowledge graph helps to provide more accurate conversational recommendation results.Extensive experiments conducted on two benchmark datasets show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of both objective and subjective evaluation metric                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Following up on the successful in-person conference held last year in Sweden, this year's theme is "HRI in the Real World," and focuses on advances that aim to bring human-robot interaction out of the lab and into everyday life.One aspect of this that we are very excited about is the introduction of a robot challenge to the conference activities, where teams from around the world will showcase their research and development via actual, interactive robots in the "real world" of an academic conference. It is our hope that this feature will grow and develop over the coming years into a staple of the HRI conference.This year's HRI conference saw an impressive surge in global interest, with 352 full paper submissions from around the world, marking a significant 40% increase compared to the previous year. These papers were categorized under relevant thematic subcommittees and underwent a double-blind review process, a rebuttal phase, and selective shepherding by the HRI program committee. From this process, 87 outstanding papers (24.7%) were chosen for full presentation at the conference.

| No             |          | A Survey on IoT Big Data: Current Status, 13 V’s Challenges, and Future Directions                                                                                                                           | Driven by the core technologies, i.e., sensor-based autonomous data acquisition and the cloud-based big data analysis, IoT automates the actuation of data-driven intelligent actions on the connected objects. This automation enables numerous useful real-life use-cases, such as smart transport, smart living, smart cities, and so on. However, recent industry surveys reflect that data-related challenges are responsible for slower growth of IoT in recent years. For this reason, this article presents a systematic and comprehensive survey on IoT Big Data (IoTBD) with the aim to identify the uncharted challenges for IoTBD. This article analyzes the state-of-the-art academic works in IoT and big data management across various domains and proposes a taxonomy for IoTBD management. Then, the survey explores the IoT portfolio of major cloud vendors and provides a classification of vendor services for the integration of IoT and IoTBD on their cloud platforms. After that, the survey identifies the IoTBD challenges in terms of 13 V’s challenges and envisions IoTBD as “Big Data 2.0.” Then the survey provides comprehensive analysis of recent works that address IoTBD challenges by highlighting their strengths and weaknesses to assess the recent trends and future research directions. Finally, the survey concludes with discussion on open research issues for IoTBD.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

The investigation, reservation, and restoration of coral reefs require accurate classifications of the specific species of corals that form those reefs through examining the underwater coral reef images. Conventionally, such classifications are performed by experts in a manual fashion. This paper proposes a cross-domain coral image classification approach using a novel structure of dual-stream hierarchical neural networks. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the approach does not only achieve state-of-the-art performances in classifying coral species but also has the capability to realize comparable and robust performances in dealing with coral image classification tasks with data from different oceanic regions and different coral life-cycle without labelling the target domains. Therefore, our approach has the potential to reduce ocean scientists' manual efforts in recognizing different species of corals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

Moreover, recent advances in deep learning have extended their capabilities to include monocular camera setup for depth estimation. Compared with the conventional devices like LiDAR or stereo cameras for the depth estimation, the monocular camera enables to estimate depths with a low cost. It is known that the depth estimation models for the monocular camera are vulnerable to adversarial examples. However, most adversarial attacks against the monocular depth estimation have been conducted with targeted patches that are placed on a target object. It is known that the targeted patch outperforms the adjacent and remote patch that is placed beyond the target object, when it comes to an attack success rate. However, the adjacent and remote patch would provide high flexibility in patch placement, as it can be placed beyond the target object's scope. In this paper, we experimentally confirm that the patch placement significantly affects the attack success rates, particularly in specific regions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Existing multi-modal domain adaptation methods treated each modality equally and optimize the sub-models of different modalities synchronously. However, as observed in this paper, the degrees of domain shift in different modalities are usually diverse. We propose a novel Differentiated Learning framework to make use of the diversity between multiple modalities for more effective domain adaptation. Specifically, we model the classifiers of different modalities as a group of teacher/student sub-models, and a novel Prototype based Reliability Measurement is presented to estimate the reliability of the recognition results made by each sub-model on the target domain. More reliable results are then picked up as teaching materials for all sub-models in the group. Considering the diversity of different modalities, each sub-model performs the Asynchronous Curriculum Learning by choosing the teaching materials from easy to hard measured by itself. Furthermore, a reliability-aware fusion scheme is proposed to combine all optimized sub-models to support final decision. Comprehensive experiments based on three multi-modal datasets with different learning tasks have been conducted, which show the superior performance of our model while comparing with state-of-the-art multi-modal domain adaptation models.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

It is introduced to represent such technical debts that are intentionally introduced by developers in the process of software development. While being able to gain short-term benefits, the introduction of SATDs often requires to be paid back later with a higher cost, e.g., introducing bugs to the software or increasing the complexity of the software.To cope with these issues, our community has proposed various machine learning-based approaches to detect SATDs. These approaches, however, are either not generic that usually require manual feature engineering efforts or do not provide promising means to explain the predicted outcomes. To that end, we propose to the community a novel approach, namely HATD (Hybrid Attention-based method for self-admitted Technical Debt detection), to detect and explain SATDs using attention-based neural networks. Through extensive experiments on 445,365 comments in 20 projects, we show that HATD is effective in detecting SATDs on both in-the-lab and in-the-wild datasets under both within-project and cross-project settings. HATD also outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in detecting and explaining SATDs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

These models encode feature interactions by the vector product between feature embedding. Despite the improvement of generalization, the memory consumption of these models grows significantly, because they usually take hundreds to thousands of large categorical features as input. Several existing works try to reduce the memory footprint by hashing, randomized embedding composition, and dimensionality search, but they suffer from either substantial performance degradation or limited memory compression. To this end, in this paper, we propose an extremely memory-efficient Factorization Machine (xLightFM), where each category embedding is composited with latent vectors selected from codebooks. Based on the characteristics of each categorical feature, we further propose to adapt the codebook size with the neural architecture search techniques for compositing the embedding of each categorical feature. This further pushes the limits of memory compression while incurring negligible degradation or even some improvements in prediction performance. We extensively evaluate the proposed algorithm with two real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that xLightFM can outperform the state-of-the-art lightweight factorization-based methods in terms of both prediction quality and memory footprint, and achieve more than 18x and 27x memory compression compared to the vanilla FM on these two datasets, respectively.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

However, if a PLC is compromised or the commands sent across a network from the PLCs are spoofed, consequences could be catastrophic. In this work, a novel technique to authenticate PLCs is proposed that aims at raising the bar against powerful attackers while being compatible with real-time systems. The proposed technique captures timing information for each controller in a non-invasive manner. It is argued that Scan Cycle is a unique feature of a PLC that can be approximated passively by observing network traffic. An attacker that spoofs commands issued by the PLCs would deviate from such fingerprints. To detect replay attacks a PLC Watermarking technique is proposed. PLC Watermarking models the relation between the scan cycle and the control logic by modeling the input/output as a function of request/response messages of a PLC. The proposed technique is validated on an operational water treatment plant (SWaT) and smart grid (EPIC) testbeds.

While documentation can be changed, the documentation changes after sprint planning may invalidate the estimated effort and sprint plan. Hence, to help the team be aware of the potential documentation changes, we developed DocWarn to estimate the probability that a work item will have documentation changes. We developed three variations of DocWarn, which are based on the characteristics extracted from the work items (DocWarn-C), the natural language text (DocWarn-T), and both inputs (DocWarn-H).Based on nine open-source projects that work in sprints and actively maintain documentation, DocWarn can predict the documentation changes with an average AUC of 0.75 and an average F1-Score of 0.36, which are significantly higher than the baselines. We also found that the most influential characteristics of a work item for determining the future documentation changes are the past tendency of the developers and the length of description text. Based on the qualitative assessment, we found that 40%-68% of the correctly predicted documentation changes were related to scope modification. With the prediction of DocWarn, the team will be better aware of the potential documentation changes during sprint planning, allowing the team to manage the uncertainty and reduce the risk of unreliable effort estimation and sprint planning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Self-admitted technical debt (SATD), a variant of technical debt, has been proposed to identify debt that is intentionally introduced during software development, e.g., temporary fixes and workarounds. Previous studies have leveraged human-summarized patterns (which represent n-gram phrases that can be used to identify SATD) or text-mining techniques to detect SATD in source code comments. However, several characteristics of SATD features in code comments, such as vocabulary diversity, project uniqueness, length, and semantic variations, pose a big challenge to the accuracy of pattern or traditional text-mining-based SATD detection, especially for cross-project deployment. Furthermore, although traditional text-mining-based method outperforms pattern-based method in prediction accuracy, the text features it uses are less intuitive than human-summarized patterns, which makes the prediction results hard to explain. To improve the accuracy of SATD prediction, especially for cross-project prediction, we propose a Convolutional Neural Network-- (CNN) based approach for classifying code comments as SATD or non-SATD. To improve the explainability of our model’s prediction results, we exploit the computational structure of CNNs to identify key phrases and patterns in code comments that are most relevant to SATD. We have conducted an extensive set of experiments with 62,566 code comments from 10 open-source projects and a user study with 150 comments of another three projects. Our evaluation confirms the effectiveness of different aspects of our approach and its superior performance, generalizability, adaptability, and explainability over current state-of-the-art traditional text-mining-based methods for SATD classification.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

However, there is an alarmingly low hardware utilization (5–20%) in large scale AI systems. The low system utilization is a cumulative effect of minor losses across different layers of the stack, exacerbated by the disconnect between engineers designing different layers spanning across different industries. To address this challenge, in this work we designed a cross-stack performance modelling and design space exploration framework. First, we introduce CrossFlow, a novel framework that enables cross-layer analysis all the way from the technology layer to the algorithmic layer. Next, we introduce DeepFlow (built on top of CrossFlow using machine learning techniques) to automate the design space exploration and co-optimization across different layers of the stack. We have validated CrossFlow’s accuracy with distributed training on real commercial hardware and showcase several DeepFlow case studies demonstrating pitfalls of not optimizing across the technology-hardware-software stack for what is likely the most important workload driving large development investments in all aspects of computing stack.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Existing skyline cardinality estimation methods are computationally infeasible for massive skyline queries over the large-scale database. In this paper, we introduce a unified skyline family w.r.t. various skyline variants. We propose an efficient and effective skyline family cardinality estimation model, named EECE, in an end-to-end manner. EECE consists of two modules, unsupervised data distribution learning (DDL) and supervised monotonic cardinality estimation (MCE). DDL leverages the mixture data guided transformer to learn the distribution of database and query parameters for model pre-training. MCE further incorporates supervised learning and parameter clamping to enhance the estimation under monotonicity guarantees. We develop an efficient incremental learning algorithm for EECE to adapt the database and query logs update. Extensive experiments on several real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that, EECE speeds up the cardinality estimation by six orders of magnitude, with more than 39% accuracy gain, compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| No             |          | MentalSpot: Effective Early Screening for Depression Based on Social Contagion                                                                                                                               | While depression is rated as the most important leading factor to global disability, early detection of depression is a non-trivial task. Existing depression detection mechanisms harvesting social media data suffer from two major limitations. First, existing solutions rely heavily on the amount, quality, and variety of content types (textual, visual, etc.) posted by users to make accurate inferences, therefore suffering from the cold-start problem when coping with users with limited training data (e.g., most existing works exclude users with fewer than 25 tweets). Second, existing approaches ignore the social impact or indication from users' social circles that can be leveraged to enhance the inference results. In this paper, we present MentalSpot, a social-contagion based depression early-screening framework using meta-learning. Specifically, we first construct a social-contagion driven data repository PsycheNet, filling the void of social-circle based depression datasets. We design a triplet network to extract users' embeddings based on the similarities of the linguistic features extracted from written texts. Afterwards, for each target user, we employ dynamic mean shift pruning to select her top-k homogeneous friends in the metric space, the texts written by whom will then be leveraged to train a friend based depression detection model. Extensive experiments show that MentalSpot outperforms the state of the art in terms of all effectiveness metrics, especially for users with very few tweets. Specifically, by using only five tweets per user, MentalSpot successfully yields an F1 score that would otherwise be achieved by the state-of-the-art methods requiring at least twenty tweets. Our approach represents a step forward to address the cold-start problem that deep learning techniques struggle with for their applications in psychiatric diagnosis. The principal beneficiaries of this study are healthcare professionals in medical institutions to determine timely and targeted interventions in a clinical setting. This study also supports non-profit groups in reaching out to people with mental health issues, helping in a global health task that cannot be fully covered by clinicians.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Nevertheless, the label annotation procedures in VG produce imbalanced query-moment-label distributions in the datasets, which severely deteriorate the learning model's capability of truly understanding the video contents. Existing works on debiased VG either focus on adjusting the learning model or conducting video-level augmentation, failing to handle the temporal bias issue caused by imbalanced query-moment-label distributions. In this paper, we propose a Disentangled Feature Mixup (DFM) framework for debiased VG, which is capable of performing unbiased grounding to tackle the temporal bias issue. Specifically, a feature-mixup augmentation strategy is designed to generate new (text, location) pairs with diverse temporal distributions via jointly augmenting the representation of text queries and the location labels. This strategy encourages making prediction based on more diverse data samples with balanced query-moment-label distributions. Furthermore, we also design a content-location disentanglement module to disentangle the representations of the temporal information and content information in videos, which is able to remove the spurious effect of temporal biases on video representation. Given that our proposed DFM framework conducts feature-level augmentation and disentanglement, it is model-agnostic and can be applied to most baselines simply yet effectively. Extensive experiments show that our proposed DFM framework is able to significantly outperform baseline models in various metrics under both independent identical distribution (i.i.d.) and out-of-distribution (o.o.d.) scenes, especially in scenarios with annotation distribution changes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

However, state-of-the-art technologies are still inadequate to distill voluminous multimodal lifelog data into high quality insights. In this article, we propose a novel semantic relevance mapping (SRM) method to tackle the problem of lifelog information access. We formulate lifelog image retrieval as a series of mapping processes where a semantic gap exists for relating basic semantic attributes with high-level query topics. The SRM serves both as a formalism to construct a trainable model to bridge the semantic gap and an algorithm to implement the training process on real-world lifelog data. Based on the SRM, we propose a computational framework of lifelog analytics to support various applications of lifelog information access, such as image retrieval, summarization, and insight visualization. Systematic evaluations are performed on three challenging benchmarking tasks to show the effectiveness of our method.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

We argue that automation and adaptation could help users to focus on their work. However, the challenge is to correctly and promptly determine when to adapt what, as often the users’ intent is unclear. To assist software developers, we build a gaze-adaptive integrated development environment using the developers’ gaze as the source for learning appropriate adaptation. Beyond our experience of using gaze for an adaptive user interface, we also report first feedback from developers regarding the desirability of such a user interface, which indicated that adaptations for development tools need to strike a careful balance between automation and user control. Nonetheless, the developers see the value in a gaze-based adaptive user interface and how it could improve software development tools going forward.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

While open-domain chatbots like ChatGPT excel in their ability to chat about any topic, task-oriented conversational agents are designed to perform goal-oriented tasks (e.g., booking or shopping) guided by a dialogue-based user interaction, which is explicitly designed. Like any kind of software system, task-oriented conversational agents need to be properly tested to ensure their quality. For this purpose, some tools permit defining and executing conversation test cases. However, there are currently no established means to assess the coverage of the design of a task-oriented agent by a test suite, or mechanisms to automate quality test case generation ensuring the agent coverage.To attack this problem, we propose test coverage criteria for task-oriented conversational agents, and define coverage-based strategies to synthesise test scenarios, some oriented to test case reduction. We provide an implementation of the criteria and the strategies that is independent of the agent development platform. Finally, we report on their evaluation on open-source Dialogflow and Rasa agents, and a comparison against a state-of-the-art testing tool.

Data-Driven Drone Security via DNN-based Approximate Computing                                                                                                                     | The safe operation of robotic aerial vehicles (RAV) requires effective security protection of their controllers against cyber-physical attacks. The frequency and sophistication of past attacks against such embedded platforms highlight the need for better defense mechanisms. Existing estimation-based control monitors have tradeoffs, with lightweight linear state estimators lacking sufficient coverage, and heavier data-driven learned models facing implementation and accuracy issues on a constrained real-time RAV. We present Mini-Me, a data-driven online monitoring framework that models the program-level control state dynamics to detect runtime data-oriented attacks against RAVs. Mini-Me leverages the internal dataflow information and control variable dependencies of RAV controller functions to train a neural network-based approximate model as the lightweight replica of the original controller programs. Mini-Me runs the minimal approximate model and detects malicious control state deviation by comparing the estimated outputs with those outputs calculated by the original controller program. We demonstrate Mini-Me on a widely adopted RAV physical model as well as popular RAV virtual models based on open-source firmware, ArduPilot and PX4, and show its effectiveness in detecting five types of attack cases with an average 0.34% space overhead and 2.6% runtime overhead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

The existing deep networks employ a single-stream network to estimate the relation between boundary map and ORI-map estimation. However, these networks fail to explore significant individual information separately. To resolve this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel two-stream generative adversarial network (GAN) for boundary map and ORI-map estimation, named OBP-GAN. The proposed OBP-GAN consists of two streams known as BP-GAN and OR-GAN. The BP-GAN estimates the boundary map, and the OR-GAN predicts the ORI-map. The boundary and ORI-map can also be useful cues for the task of depth-map refinement from single images. Therefore, in this work, we propose a transformer-based depth-map refinement network (TRANSDMR-GAN) for refining the depth estimated from monocular images using boundary and ORI-map. We conducted extensive analyses on indoor and outdoor datasets to validate our proposed OBP-GAN and TRANSDMR-GAN. The extensive experimental analysis and ablation study demonstrate the ability of the proposed OBP-GAN to generate state-of-the-art occlusion boundary maps. Furthermore, we show that the proposed network, TRANSDMR-GAN, can generate an edge-enhanced depth map without degrading the accuracy of the initial depth map.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Such explainability is especially essential for domain adaptation, whose challenges require developing more adaptive models across different domains. In this article, we ask the question: How much does each sample in the source domain contribute to the network’s prediction on the samples from the target domain? To address this, we devise a novel Interpretable Deep Classifier (IDC) that learns the nearest source samples of a target sample as evidence upon which the classifier makes the decision. Technically, IDC maintains a differentiable memory bank for each category, and the memory slot derives a form of key–value pair. The key records the features of discriminative source samples, and the value stores the corresponding properties, e.g., representative scores of the features for describing the category. IDC computes the loss between the output of IDC and the labels of source samples to back-propagate to adjust the representative scores and update the memory banks. Extensive experiments on Office-Home and VisDA-2017 datasets demonstrate that our IDC leads to a more explainable model with almost no accuracy degradation and effectively calibrates classification for optimum reject options. More remarkably, when taking IDC as a prior interpreter, capitalizing on 0.1% source training data selected by IDC still yields superior results than that uses full training set on VisDA-2017 for unsupervised domain adaptation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Changes in the domain models exist due to system evolution and the emergence of new requirements. In these applications, domain models evolve using CRUD operations requested by users. However, it is necessary to support changes in domain models during the applications’ runtime when new (unforeseen) situations may occur. This work presents an architecture called DoME, which relies on natural language processing (NLP) to allow users to trigger changes in the domain models and self-adaptation techniques to update the models at runtime. It is instantiated in a concrete architecture using a chatbot in Telegram and Transformers Libraries for NLP. The architecture has been preliminary evaluated regarding its assertiveness and user satisfaction, resulting in an 82.55% hit rate and confirming that NL provides good usability and facilitates data manipulation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Currently, the assessment is mainly based on subjective questionnaires and clinical opinions. This work aims to infer the depression level through analysing multimodal data, as a tool to support medical experts and patients in depression screening and diagnosis. We introduce a fusion method to estimate the Beck Depression Inventory II scores using multiple inputs: facial images, video-based blood volume pulse signals, and speech data. Each modality has its own regression model, based on the ResNet-50 architecture. Our approach leverages the synchrony between regression scores of these models to produce the fusion values. Specifically, we calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient and the dynamic time warping distance between sliding windows of the score sequences to find the optimal segments for fusion. We evaluate our method on the dataset of the fourth Audio-Visual Emotion Recognition Challenge (AVEC 2014). We achieve a Mean Absolute Error of 6.08 and a Root Mean Squared Error of 8.60, which are lower than those of each single-modality model.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

This year, we have returned to Portland, Oregon. We hope that, like us, you are looking forward to a highly productive and engaging symposium that provides ample opportunity to renew old relationships, build new connections, and learn about the latest advances in our field. While we are sure that there will be a few surprises along the way, we hope and expect that we won't experience anything nearly as disruptive as the opening days of the pandemic, which occurred when we last tried to gather here in 2020.Our theme for this year's symposium is "Blazing New Trails in CS Education." This broad theme captures the exceptional work being performed by this community to enhance our teaching, improve our assessments, attract diverse students, and all of the other laudable projects, initiatives, and undertakings that affect positive change. The breadth of the program is substantial - there truly should be something for everyone. In fact, your biggest challenge may be deciding which session to attend in each time slot because there is so much going on! We know that many of you want to attend as many sessions as possible while you are here in Portland, but we encourage you to also find a little bit of time for yourself so that you leave Portland refreshed, renewed and encouraged, rather than exhausted or burnt out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

A dataset named Khasi Abusive Language Dataset (KALD) was created which consists of 4,573 human-annotated Khasi YouTube and Facebook comments. A corpus of Khasi text was built and it was used to create Khasi word2vec and fastText word embeddings. Deep learning, traditional machine learning, and ensemble models were used in the study. Experiments were performed using word2vec, fastText, and topic vectors obtained using LDA. Experiments were also performed to check if zero-shot cross-lingual nature of language models such as LaBSE and LASER can be utilized for abusive language detection in the Khasi language.

However, upgrading a recommendation system with numerous new data consumes much time and computing resources. To mitigate this problem, we propose a Task-Adversarial Adaptation (TAA) framework, which is able to align data distributions and reduce resource consumption at the same time. This framework is specifically designed to align distributions of embedded features for different recommendation tasks between the source domain (i.e., historical data) and the target domain (i.e., new data). Technically, we design a domain feature discriminator for each task to distinguish which domain a feature comes from. By the two-player min-max game between the feature discriminator and the feature embedding network, the feature embedding network is able to align the source and target data distributions. With the ability to align source and target distributions, we are able to reduce the number of training samples by random sampling. In addition, we formulate the proposed approach as a plug-and-play module to accelerate the model training and improve the performance of mainstream multi-modal multi-task recommendation systems. We evaluate our method by predicting the Click-Through Rate (CTR) in e-commerce scenarios. Extensive experiments verify that our method is able to significantly improve prediction performance and accelerate model training on the target domain. For instance, our method is able to surpass the previous state-of-the-art method by 2.45% in terms of Area Under Curve (AUC) on AliExpress_US dataset while only utilizing one percent of the target data in training.

| No             |          | MEMOS: A Multi-modal Emotion Stream Database for Temporal Spontaneous Emotional State Detection                                                                                                              | Mental health applications are increasingly interested in using audio-visual and physiological measurements to detect the emotional state of a person, where significant researches aim to detect episodic emotional state. The availability of wearable devices and advanced signals is attracting researchers to explore the detection of a continuous sequence of emotion categories, referred to as emotion stream, for understanding mental health. Currently, there are no established databases for experimenting with emotion streams. In this paper, we make two contributions. First, we collect a Multi-modal EMOtion Stream (MEMOS) database in the scenario of social games. Audio-video recordings of the players are made via mobile phones and aligned Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals are collected by wearable sensors. Totally 40 multi-modal sessions have been recorded, each lasting between 25 to 70 minutes. Emotional states with time boundaries are self-reported and annotated by the participants while watching the video recordings. Secondly, we propose a two-step emotional state detection framework to automatically determine the emotion categories with their time boundaries along the video recordings. Experiments on the MEMOS database provide the baseline result for temporal emotional state detection research, with average mean-average-precision (mAP) score as 8.109% on detecting the five emotions (happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, other negative emotions) in videos. It is higher than 5.47% where the emotions are detected by averaging the frame-level confidence scores (obtained by Face++ emotion recognition API) in the segments from a sliding window. We expect that this paper will introduce a novel research problem and provide a database for related research.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

We show how these primitives can be combined into a set of interaction patterns which can capture common interactions between humans and AI/ML models. The motivation behind this is twofold: firstly, to provide a compact generalisation of existing practices for the design and implementation of HAI interactions; and secondly, to support the creation of new interactions by extending the design space of HAI interactions. Taking into consideration frameworks, guidelines and taxonomies related to human-centered design and implementation of AI systems, we define a vocabulary for describing information exchanges based on the model’s characteristics and interactional capabilities. Based on this vocabulary, a message passing model for interactions between humans and models is presented, which we demonstrate can account for existing HAI interaction systems and approaches. Finally, we build this into design patterns which can describe common interactions between users and models, and we discuss how this approach can be used towards a design space for HAI interactions that creates new possibilities for designs as well as keeping track of implementation issues and concerns.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

While the accessibility community has explored ways to make data more accessible to blind and low-vision (BLV) people, little is known about how BLV people perform DDA. Knowing BLV people’s strategies and challenges in DDA would allow the community to make DDA more accessible to them. Toward this goal, we conducted a mixed-methods study of interviews and think-aloud sessions with BLV people (N=16). Our study revealed five key approaches for DDA (i.e., overview obtaining, column comparison, key statistics identification, note-taking, and data validation) and the associated challenges. We discussed the implications of our findings and highlighted potential directions to make DDA more accessible for BLV people.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

It is therefore appealing for domain adaptation approaches to consider incorporating SSL. The intuition is to enforce instance-level feature consistency such that the predictor becomes somehow invariant across domains. However, most existing SSL methods in the regime of domain adaptation usually are treated as standalone auxiliary components, leaving the signatures of domain adaptation unattended. Actually, the optimal region where the domain gap vanishes and the instance level constraint that SSL peruses may not coincide at all. From this point, we present a particular paradigm of self-supervised learning tailored for domain adaptation, i.e., Transferrable Contrastive Learning (TCL), which links the SSL and the desired cross-domain transferability congruently. We find contrastive learning intrinsically a suitable candidate for domain adaptation, as its instance invariance assumption can be conveniently promoted to cross-domain class-level invariance favored by domain adaptation tasks. Based on particular memory bank constructions and pseudo label strategies, TCL then penalizes cross-domain intra-class domain discrepancy between source and target through a clean and novel contrastive loss. The free lunch is, thanks to the incorporation of contrastive learning, TCL relies on a moving-averaged key encoder that naturally achieves a temporally ensembled version of pseudo labels for target data, which avoids pseudo label error propagation at no extra cost. TCL therefore efficiently reduces cross-domain gaps. Through extensive experiments on benchmarks (Office-Home, VisDA-2017, Digits-five, PACS and DomainNet) for both single-source and multi-source domain adaptation tasks, TCL has demonstrated state-of-the-art performances.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Therefore, we propose to investigate a new problem namely the Continuous Domain Adaptation (CDA) through the lens where infinite domains are formed by continuously varying attributes. Leveraging knowledge of two labeled source domains and several observed unlabeled target domains data, the objective of CDA is to learn a generalized model for whole data distribution with the continuous attribute. Besides the contributions of formulating a new problem, we also propose a novel approach as a strong CDA baseline. To be specific, firstly we propose a novel alternating training strategy to reduce discrepancies among multiple domains meanwhile generalize to unseen target domains. Secondly, we propose a continuity constraint when estimating the cross-domain divergence measurement. Finally, to decouple the discrepancy from the mini-batch size, we design a domain-specific queue to maintain the global view of the source domain that further boosts the adaptation performances. Our method is proven to achieve the state-of-the-art in CDA problem using extensive experiments.

Recently, active domain adaptation (ADA) has been proposed as a new paradigm which significantly boosts performance of UDA with minor additional labeling. However, existing ADA methods require source data to explicitly measure the domain gap between the source domain and the target domain, which is restricted in many real-world scenarios. In this work, we handle ADA with only a source-pretrained model and unlabeled target data, proposing a new setting named source-free active domain adaptation. Specifically, we propose a Locality Preserving Transfer (LPT) framework which preserves and utilizes locality structures on target data to achieve adaptation without source data. Meanwhile, a label propagation strategy is adopted to improve the discriminability for better adaptation. After LPT, unique samples with insignificant locality structure are identified by an energy-based approach for active annotation. An energy-based pseudo labeling strategy is further applied to generate labels for reliable samples. Finally, with supervision from the annotated samples and pseudo labels, a well adapted model is obtained. Extensive experiments on three widely used UDA benchmarks show that our method is comparable or superior to current state-of-the-art active domain adaptation methods even without access to source data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| No             |          | A closer look at quality-aware runtime assessment of sensing models in multi-device environments                                                                                                             | The increasing availability of multiple sensory devices on or near a human body has opened brand new opportunities to leverage redundant sensory signals for powerful sensing applications. For instance, personal-scale sensory inferences with motion and audio signals can be done individually on a smartphone, a smartwatch, and even an earbud - each offering unique sensor quality, model accuracy, and runtime behaviour. At execution time, however, it is incredibly challenging to assess these characteristics to select the best device for accurate and resource-efficient inferences. To this end, we look at a quality-aware collaborative sensing system that actively interplays across multiple devices and respective sensing models. It dynamically selects the best device as a function of model accuracy at any given context. We propose two complementary techniques for the runtime quality assessment. Borrowing principles from active learning, our first technique runs on three heuristic-based quality assessment functions that employ confidence, margin sampling, and entropy of models' output. Our second technique is built with a siamese neural network and acts on the premise that runtime sensing quality can be learned from historical data. Our evaluation across multiple motion and audio datasets shows that our techniques provide 12% increase in overall accuracy through dynamic device selection at the average expense of 13 mW power on each device as compared to traditional single-device approaches.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

While re- markable advances have been witnessed recently, the power of DA methods still heavily depends on the network depth, especially when the domain discrepancy is large, posing an unprecedented challenge to DA in low-resource scenarios where fast and adaptive inference is required. How to bridge transferability and resource- efficient inference in DA becomes an important problem. In this paper, we propose Resource Efficient Domain Adaptation (REDA), a general framework that can adaptively adjust computation re- sources across 'easier' and 'harder' inputs. Based on existing multi- exit architectures, REDA has two novel designs: 1) Transferable distillation to distill the transferability of top classifier into the early exits; 2) Consistency weighting to control the distillation degree via prediction consistency. As a general method, REDA can be easily applied with a variety of DA methods. Empirical results and analy- ses justify that REDA can substantially improve the accuracy and accelerate the inference under domain shift and low resource.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

However, due to the limited style diversity in source training data, most existing VIR models always fail to generalize well to unseen domain. How to improve the generalizability of VIR models has received increasing attention in most recent years.In this paper, we pay attention to the Single Domain Generalization (SDG) based VIR task, a more challenging but practical problem, where the model is only trained on single domain data and directly evaluated on unseen target domain without any fine-tuning or adaptations. In this case, the limited style variance in training data may cause the model learning incorrect reliance on the superficial style feature and reduce the generalizability of the model. To address this issue, we propose a novel Style-Invariant robust Representation Learning (SIRL) method for the challenging task, which mainly aims to first diversify the training data with style augmentation, and then enforce the model to learn style-invariant features. Specifically, we first design an adversarial style synthesis module which learns to synthesize diverse augmented samples with adversarially learned styles. Then, we devise an invariant feature learning module to minimize cross-domain feature inconsistency between source images and style-augmented images for capturing domain-invariant instance features. In this way, we can prevent the model from over-exploiting semantic content-independent cues (e.g., color) as shortcut features, thereby estimating the pairwise instance similarity more robustly. We integrate our SIRL method with SOTA VIR networks and evaluate its effectiveness on several public benchmark datasets. Extensive experiments clearly show that the SIRL method can substantially improve the generalizability of existing VIR networks in the challenging SDG-VIR setting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

However, previous learning-based power models ignore the discrepancies in data distribution among different CPU designs, making it difficult to use data from the historical configuration to aid modeling for new target configuration. In this paper, we investigate the transferability of power models and propose a microarchitecture power modeling method based on transfer learning (TL). A novel TL method for artificial neural network (ANN)-based power models is proposed, where cross-domain mixup generates more auxiliary samples close to the target configuration to fill in the distribution discrepancy and domain-adversarial training extracts domain-invariant features to complete the target model construction. Experiments show that our method greatly improves the model transferability and can effectively utilize the knowledge of the existing CPU configuration to facilitate target power model construction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

We aim to evaluate the effectiveness of using social media data and the Transformer model in forecasting market trends for Bitcoin. By analyzing social media posts and incorporating them into predictive models, we demonstrate the potential of the Transformer architecture in capturing complex dependencies and patterns within sequential Bitcoin prices. Additionally, different clustering methods are applied to process the original social media data in a rolling manner. The evaluation of Transformer-based models on historical data showcases their predictive performance compared to various social media data clustering approaches. Furthermore, the impact of incorporating outliers of social media data into the Transformer model is explored to improve prediction accuracy. The results of this study demonstrate the potential of clustering on social media data and the Transformer model for forecasting market trends.1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Unlike general clinical discussions, psychotherapy's core components (viz. symptoms) are hard to distinguish, thus becoming a complex problem to summarize later. A structured counseling conversation may contain discussions about symptoms, history of mental health issues, or the discovery of the patient's behavior. It may also contain discussion filler words irrelevant to a clinical summary. We refer to these elements of structured psychotherapy as counseling components. In this paper, the aim is mental health counseling summarization to build upon domain knowledge and to help clinicians quickly glean meaning. We create a new dataset after annotating 12.9K utterances of counseling components and reference summaries for each dialogue. Further, we propose ConSum, a novel counseling-component guided summarization model. ConSum undergoes three independent modules. First, to assess the presence of depressive symptoms, it filters utterances utilizing the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), while the second and third modules aim to classify counseling components. At last, we propose a problem-specific Mental Health Information Capture (MHIC) evaluation metric for counseling summaries. Our comparative study shows that we improve on performance and generate cohesive, semantic, and coherent summaries. We comprehensively analyze the generated summaries to investigate the capturing of psychotherapy elements. Human and clinical evaluations on the summary show that ConSum generates quality summary. Further, mental health experts validate the clinical acceptability of the ConSum. Lastly, we discuss the uniqueness in mental health counseling summarization in the real world and show evidences of its deployment on an online application with the support of mpathic.ai                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Mismatches between the automated and the driver preferred driving styles can make users take over more frequently or even disable the automation features. This work proposes identification of user driving style preference with multimodal signals, so the vehicle could match user preference in a continuous and automatic way. We conducted a driving simulator study with 36 participants and collected extensive multimodal data including behavioral, physiological, and situational data. This includes eye gaze, steering grip force, driving maneuvers, brake and throttle pedal inputs as well as foot distance from pedals, pupil diameter, galvanic skin response, heart rate, and situational drive context. Then, we built machine learning models to identify preferred driving styles, and confirmed that all modalities are important for the identification of user preference. This work paves the road for implicit adaptive driving styles on automated vehicles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

However, in many parts of the world, patients do not actively seek professional diagnosis because of stigma attached to mental illness, ignorance of mental health and its associated symptoms. In this paper, we propose a model for passively detecting mental disorders using conversations on Reddit. Specifically, we focus on a subset of mental disorders that are characterized by distinct emotional patterns (henceforth called emotional disorders): major depressive, anxiety, and bipolar disorders. Through passive (i.e., unprompted) detection, we can encourage patients to seek diagnosis and treatment for mental disorders. Our proposed model is different from other work in this area in that our model is based entirely on the emotional states, and the transition between these states of users on Reddit, whereas prior work is typically based on content-based representations (e.g., n-grams, language model embeddings, etc). We show that content-based representation is affected by domain and topic bias and thus does not generalize, while our model, on the other hand, suppresses topic-specific information and thus generalizes well across different topics and times. We conduct experiments on our model’s ability to detect different emotional disorders and on the generalizability of our model. Our experiments show that while our model performs comparably to content-based models, such as BERT, it generalizes much better across time and topic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

However, obtaining long-distance pedestrian information on actual scenes has problems, such as lack of information, incomplete feature extraction, and low attribute recognition accuracy. To address these issues, we proposed a Dual Adaptive Fusion Attention and Criss-Cross Attention Module (DAFCC). This module contains two sub-modules: First, the dual adaptive fusion attention module automatically adjusts the weights of attributes in different scales, then fusion the different scale features and makes attribute extraction more complete. Second, we employ criss-cross attention to extract rich contextual information, which is beneficial for visual understanding. By training on the public PA-100K, RAP and PETA datasets, the mean accuracies achieved 81.09%, 81.44% and 85.94%, respectively.

However, the adversarial vulnerability of domain adaptation models has largely been neglected. Most existing unsupervised domain adaptation algorithms might be easily fooled by an adversary, resulting in deteriorated prediction performance on the target domain, when transferring the knowledge from a maliciously manipulated source domain.To demonstrate the adversarial vulnerability of existing domain adaptation techniques, in this paper, we propose a generic data poisoning attack framework named I2Attack for domain adaptation with the following properties: (1) perceptibly unnoticeable: all the poisoned inputs are natural-looking; (2)adversarially indirect: only source examples are maliciously manipulated; (3) algorithmically invisible: both source classification error and marginal domain discrepancy between source and target domains will not increase. Specifically, it aims to degrade the overall prediction performance on the target domain by maximizing the label-informed domain discrepancy over both input feature space and class-label space be-tween source and target domains. Within this framework, a family of practical poisoning attacks are presented to fool the existing domain adaptation algorithms associated with different discrepancy measures. Extensive experiments on various domain adaptation benchmarks confirm the effectiveness and computational efficiency of our proposed I2Attack framework.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Current misinformation detection solutions often suffer from the lack of resources (e.g., labeled datasets, sufficient medical knowledge) in the emerging health domain to accurately identify online misinformation at an early stage. To address such a limitation, we develop a knowledge-driven domain adaptive approach that explores a good set of annotated data and reliable knowledge facts in a source domain (e.g., COVID-19) to learn the domain-invariant features that can be adapted to detect misinformation in the emergent target domain with little ground truth labels (e.g., Monkeypox). Two critical challenges exist in developing our solution: i) how to leverage the noisy knowledge facts in the source domain to obtain the medical knowledge related to the target domain? ii) How to adapt the domain discrepancy between the source and target domains to accurately assess the truthfulness of the social media posts in the target domain? To address the above challenges, we develop KAdapt, a knowledge-driven domain adaptive early misinformation detection framework that explicitly extracts relevant knowledge facts from the source domain and jointly learns the domain-invariant representation of the social media posts and their relevant knowledge facts to accurately identify misleading posts in the target domain. Evaluation results on five real-world datasets demonstrate that KAdapt significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of accurately detecting misleading Monkeypox posts on social media.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

We use the concept of full-duplex in telecommunication to demonstrate what a human-like interactive experience should be and how to achieve smooth turn-taking through three subtasks: user state detection, backchannel selection, and barge-in detection. Besides, we propose semi-supervised learning with multimodal data augmentation to leverage unlabeled data to increase model generalization. Experimental results on three sub-tasks show that the proposed method achieves consistent improvements compared with baselines. We deploy the Duplex Conversation to Alibaba intelligent customer service and share lessons learned in production. Online A/B experiments show that the proposed system can significantly reduce response latency by 50%.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| No             |          | OptimML: Joint Control of Inference Latency and Server Power Consumption for ML Performance Optimization                                                                                                     | Power capping is an important technique for high-density servers to safely oversubscribe the power infrastructure in a data center. However, power capping is commonly accomplished by dynamically lowering the server processors’ frequency levels, which can result in degraded application performance. For servers that run important machine learning (ML) applications with Service-Level Objective (SLO) requirements, inference performance such as recognition accuracy must be optimized within a certain latency constraint, which demands high server performance. In order to achieve the best inference accuracy under the desired latency and server power constraints, this paper proposes OptimML, a multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) control framework that jointly controls both inference latency and server power consumption, by flexibly adjusting the machine learning model size (and so its required computing resources) when server frequency needs to be lowered for power capping. Our results on a hardware testbed with widely adopted ML framework (including PyTorch, TensorFlow, and MXNet) show that OptimML achieves higher inference accuracy compared with several well-designed baselines, while respecting both latency and power constraints. Furthermore, an adaptive control scheme with online model switching and estimation is designed to achieve analytic assurance of control accuracy and system stability, even in the face of significant workload/hardware variations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Numerous works focus on obtaining well-calibrated predictive models, but less is known about reliably assessing model calibration. This limits our ability to know when algorithms for improving calibration have a real effect, and when their improvements are merely artifacts due to random noise in finite datasets. In this work, we consider detecting mis-calibration of predictive models using a finite validation dataset as a hypothesis testing problem. The null hypothesis is that the predictive model is calibrated, while the alternative hypothesis is that the deviation from calibration is sufficiently large.We find that detecting mis-calibration is only possible when the conditional probabilities of the classes are sufficiently smooth functions of the predictions. When the conditional class probabilities are H\\"{o}lder continuous, we propose T-Cal, a minimax optimal test for calibration based on a debiased plug-in estimator of the ℓ2-Expected Calibration Error (ECE). We further propose adaptive T-Cal, a version that is adaptive to unknown smoothness. We verify our theoretical findings with a broad range of experiments, including with several popular deep neural net architectures and several standard post-hoc calibration methods. T-Cal is a practical general-purpose tool, which--combined with classical tests for discrete-valued predictors--can be used to test the calibration of virtually any probabilistic classification method.

Initially, the random forest algorithm is employed for feature selection and to obtain the influence coefficients of each process parameter on the roasting quality. Subsequently, based on the deep reinforcement learning algorithm, the prediction of roasting quality in the roasting machine is modeled as a guessing game. Starting from the elements of the reinforcement learning algorithm, a prediction model for roasting quality is established, and a deep neural network is used to approximate the decision network for finding the optimal strategy. This approach realizes roasting quality prediction using the deep reinforcement learning algorithm, and investigates the impact of the distribution of quality types in different sample data on the accuracy of roasting quality prediction. The feasibility and universality of this method are demonstrated through experimentation. Based on the prediction results and combined with the influence coefficients of each process parameter on roasting quality, a basis is provided for the control optimization of the roasting process in the roasting machine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Interaction will increasingly happen on the go, causing I/O to become constrained, ultimately leading to reliance on user intent prediction for aid. In this pictorial, we argue that to support the development of such systems, new predictive UI toolkits are required. We place the reader in the shoes of an App designer and outline the challenges that will be faced. We then describe a new predictive toolkit, leveraging Fuzzy Widgets, or “Fidgets” as the main UI building block. Fidgets extend Responsive Design into the realm of intelligent systems, to adapt not only to spatial constraints, but to system predictions as well. We then describe a working implementation of a predictive music application, built using our described framework, showcasing its benefits and range of adaptive abilities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

In this paper, we present Pronunciation Teacher&nbsp;(PTeacher), a Computer-Aided Pronunciation Training (CAPT) system that provides personalized exaggerated audio-visual corrective feedback for mispronunciations. Though the effectiveness of exaggerated feedback has been demonstrated, it is still unclear how to define the appropriate degrees of exaggeration when interacting with individual learners. To fill in this gap, we interview 100 L2 English learners and 22 professional native teachers to understand their needs and experiences. Three critical metrics are proposed for both learners and teachers to identify the best exaggeration levels in both audio and visual modalities. Additionally, we incorporate the personalized dynamic feedback mechanism given the English proficiency of learners. Based on the obtained insights, a comprehensive interactive pronunciation training course is designed to help L2 learners rectify mispronunciations in a more perceptible, understandable, and discriminative manner.

Compared with the traditional two-phase approach, forecasting equity's trend and then weighting them by combinatorial optimization, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods have shown advances in reward chasing with optimal policies. However, existing DRL-based methods either leverage portfolio optimization on low-frequency scenarios or only support a very limited number of assets with discrete action space, facing significant computing efficiency challenges. Therefore, we propose an efficient DRL-based policy optimization (DRPO) method for high-frequency trading. In particular, we model the portfolio management task with Markov Decision Process by directly inferring the equity weights in the action space guided by maximum accumulated returns. To reduce agents' interaction complexity without reducing interpretation, we detach the environment into the "static'' market states and "dynamic'' portfolio weight states. Then, we design an efficient reward expectation calculation algorithm via probabilistic dynamic programming, which enables our agents directly collect feedback away from trajectory sampling-based morass. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that solves the high-frequency portfolio optimization problem by devising an efficient continuous space policy optimization algorithm in the DRL framework. Through extensive experiments on the real-world data from Dow Jones, Coinbase and SSE exchanges, we show that our proposed DRPO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art benchmark methods. The results demonstrate the practical applicability and effectiveness of the proposed method.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

This paper targets the Depression Detection Challenge with AI Sub-challenge (DDS) task of Audio Visual Emotion Challenge (AVEC) 2019. Firstly, two task-specific features are proposed: 1) deep contextual text features, which incorporate global text features and sentiment scores estimated by fine-tuned Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT); 2) span-wise dense temporal statistical features, in which multiple statistical functions are conducted in each continuous time span. Furthermore, we propose a multi-scale temporal dilated CNN to precisely capture the hidden temporal dependency in the data for automatic multi-modality depression detection. Our proposed framework achieves competitive performance with Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) of 0.466 on development set and 0.430 on test set which is remarkably higher than the baseline result of 0.269 on development set and 0.120 on test set.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

It requires a model to train on multi-source domains and then generalizes well on unseen target domains. Existing approaches typically mix images from different domains in a mini-batch for training, but this can increase discrimination within a mini-batch due to the vast style differences among domains. As a result, the model may converge easily by mining domain-related information, while neglecting identity-discriminative information, especially for metric learning. To improve the difficulty of metric learning under multi-source training, we design a Style-aware Hard-negative Sampling (SHS) strategy. SHS effectively improves metric learning but reduces the style diversity within the batch. To enhance style diversity, we devise a Dynamic Style Mixing (DSM) which memorizes single-domain styles and synthesizes novel styles, which largely raises the diversity of source domains. Extensive experiments prove the effectiveness of our method.

The classification is embedded in a sensor-instrumented insole and is based on ground reaction forces (GRFs). GRF data have been successfully used for the classification of gait patterns into clinically relevant classes and are frequently used in clinical practice to quantitatively describe human motion. A feed-forward neural network that was implemented on the firmware of the insole is used to estimate the GRFs using pressure and accelerator data. Compared to GRF measurements obtained from force plates, the estimated GRFs performed highly accurately. To distinguish between normal physiological gait and gait disorders, we trained and evaluated a support vector machine with labeled data from a publicly accessible database. The automated gait classification was sonified for auditory feedback. The high potential of the implemented auditory feedback for preventive and supportive applications in physical therapy, such as supervised therapy settings and tele-rehabilitation, was highlighted by a semi-structured interview with two experts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Low-SES significantly affects students and their education worldwide. In the United States, students from various ethnic and racial minorities, such as Hispanic, Latino, and African American populations, experience physical and psychological challenges due to low quality of life. Extensive research in various fields, particularly the social sciences, has examined diverse issues for students with low SES. Despite the profound potential of computing, particularly in natural language processing (NLP), to improve the quality of life for these individuals, NLP has yet to make substantial contributions to addressing these inequalities. In this paper, we highlighted the limited contribution of NLP compared to other disciplines in understanding and addressing the problems of low-SES students. Then, we discuss how to bridge this gap by developing NLP tools and techniques from the narratives of low-SES students, including factor and cause-effect analysis, building a knowledge graph, developing helpful apps specifically designed for them. Accomplishing this objective would represent a significant step forward in enhancing the well-being of students from low socioeconomic backgrounds. Additionally, we manually created and published a data set consisting of 74 posts and comments from Reddit for the NLP community to conduct proposed research on low-SES students.

However, such representations may still confuse two patterns due to the domain gap. Considering that semantic information is useful for the final task and domain information always indicates the discrepancy between two domains, to address this issue, we propose to decouple the representations of semantic features from domain features to reduce domain bias. Different from traditional methods, we adopt a simple but effective module with only one domain discriminator to decouple the representations, offering two benefits. Firstly, it eliminates the need for labeled sample pairs, making it more suitable for UDA. Secondly, without adversarial learning, our model can achieve a more stable training phase. Moreover, to further enhance the task-specific features, we employ a causal mechanism to separate semantic features related to causal factors from the overall feature representations. Specially, we utilize a dual-classifier strategy, where each classifier is fed with the entire features and the semantic features, respectively. By minimizing the discrepancy between the outputs of the two classifiers, the causal influence of the semantic features is accentuated. Experiments on several public datasets demonstrate the proposed model can outperform the state-of-the-art methods.

Most existing UDA methods try to learn domain-invariant features so that the classifier trained by the source labels can automatically be adapted to the target domain. However, recent works have shown the limitations of these methods when label distributions differ between the source and target domains. Especially, in partial domain adaptation (PDA) where the source domain holds plenty of individual labels (private labels) not appeared in the target domain, the domain-invariant features can cause catastrophic performance degradation. In this paper, based on the originally favorable underlying structures of the two domains, we learn two kinds of target features, i.e., the source-approximate features and target-approximate features instead of the domain-invariant features. The source-approximate features utilize the consistency of the two domains to estimate the distribution of the source private labels. The target-approximate features enhance the feature discrimination in the target domain while detecting the hard (outlier) target samples. A novel Coupled Approximation Neural Network (CANN) has been proposed to co-train the source-approximate and target-approximate features by two parallel sub-networks without sharing the parameters. We apply CANN to three prevalent transfer learning benchmark datasets, Office-Home, Office-31, and Visda2017 with both UDA and PDA settings. The results show that CANN outperforms all baselines by a large margin in PDA and also performs best in UDA.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Producing sign language videos showing a human interpreter is often not feasible due to the amount of data required or because the information changes frequently. The ongoing AVASAG project addresses this issue by developing a 3D sign language avatar for the automatic translation of texts into sign language for public services. The avatar is trained using recordings of human interpreters translating text into sign language. For this purpose, we create a corpus with video and motion capture data and an annotation scheme that allows for real-time translation and subsequent correction without requiring to correct the animation frames manually. This paper presents the general translation pipeline focusing on innovative points, such as adjusting an existing annotation system to the specific requirements of sign language and making it usable to annotators from the Deaf communities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Typically, polarization manifests itself in the public discourse in politics, governance and ideology. In recent years, however, polarization arises increasingly in a wider range of issues, from identity and culture to healthcare and the environment. As the public and private discourse moves online, polarization feeds in and is fed by phenomena like fake news and hate speech. The identification and analysis of online polarization is challenging because of the massive scale, diversity, and unstructured nature of online content, and the rapid and unpredictable evolution of polarizing issues. Therefore, we need effective ways to identify, quantify, and represent polarization and polarizing topics algorithmically and at scale. In this work, we introduce POLAR - an unsupervised, large-scale framework for modeling and identifying polarizing topics in any domain, without prior domain-specific knowledge. POLAR comprises a processing pipeline that analyzes a corpus of an arbitrary number of news articles to construct a hierarchical knowledge graph that models polarization and identify polarizing topics discussed in the corpus.

To solve this issue, we propose a novel model named Hierarchical Bi-directional Feature Perception Network (HBFP-Net) to correlate multi-level information and reinforce each other. First, the correlation maps of cross-level feature-pairs are modeled via low-rank bilinear pooling. Then, based on the correlation maps, Bi-directional Feature Perception (BFP) module is employed to enrich the attention regions of high-level feature, and to learn abstract and specific information in low-level feature. And then, we propose a novel end-to-end hierarchical network which integrates multi-level augmented features and inputs the augmented low- and middle-level features to following layers to retrain a new powerful network. What's more, we propose a novel trainable generalized pooling, which can dynamically select any value of all locations in feature maps to be activated. Extensive experiments implemented on the mainstream evaluation datasets including Market-1501, CUHK03 and DukeMTMC-ReID show that our method outperforms the recent SOTA Re-ID models.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Timely detection of the objectionable content is very important for its prevention and reduction. This article explores and spotlights diversity of definitions of cyber-aggression, cyberbulling, and cyber-grooming; analyzes current categorization systems and taxonomies; identifies the targets, target categories, and subcategories of the subjects of the objectionable content research; analyzes the ambiguity of the linguistic terms in the domain; reviews present databases gathered for researching the field; explores types of features used for modeling systems for automatic detection; and examines methods for automatic detection and/or prediction of the objectionable content. The results point to directions of system development for tracing transformations of objectionable content over time on different online social platforms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

However, the optimal process for the development of AI is through repeated cycles of learning and implementation that may pose challenges to our existing system of regulating medical devices. Product developers face the tensions between the benefits of continuous improvement/deployment of algorithms and of keeping products unchanged to collect evidence for safety assurance processes. The challenge is how to balance potential benefits with the need to assure their safety. Governance and assurance requirements that can accommodate the live or near-live machine learning (ML) approach will be needed soon, as it is an approach likely to soon be of high importance in healthcare and in other fields of application. We have entered a phase of regulatory experimentation with various novel approaches emerging around the world. The process of social learning is not only about the application of AI but also about the institutional arrangements for its safe and dependable deployment, including regulatory experimentation, likely within sandboxes. This paper will reflect on the discussions from two recent Chatham House workshops on regulating AI in software as a medical device (SaMD), hosted by the UKRI/EPSRC project on ‘Trustworthy Autonomous Systems: Regulation and Governance’ node, with a special focus on the recent regulatory attempts in the UK and internationally.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Nevertheless, constrained structured prediction is still limited in real-world applications because of the lack of tools to bridge constraint satisfaction and machine learning. In this paper, we propose COnstraint REasoning embedded Structured Prediction (Core-Sp), a scalable constraint reasoning and machine learning integrated approach for learning over structured domains. We propose to embed decision diagrams, a popular constraint reasoning tool, as a fully-differentiable module into deep neural networks for structured prediction. We also propose an iterative search algorithm to automate the searching process of the best Core-Sp structure. We evaluate Core-Sp on three applications: vehicle dispatching service planning, if-then program synthesis, and text2SQL generation. The proposed Core-Sp module demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art approaches in all three applications. The structures generated with Core-Sp satisfy 100% of the constraints when using exact decision diagrams. In addition, Core-Sp boosts learning performance by reducing the modeling space via constraint satisfaction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

We collect over 125,000 photos in the wild from N=177 participants diagnosed with major depressive disorder for 90 days. Images are captured naturalistically while participants respond to the PHQ-8 depression survey question: “I have felt down, depressed, or hopeless”. Our analysis explores important image attributes, such as angle, dominant colors, location, objects, and lighting. We show that a random forest trained with face landmarks can classify samples as depressed or non-depressed and predict raw PHQ-8 scores effectively. Our post-hoc analysis provides several insights through an ablation study, feature importance analysis, and bias assessment.

On the other sides, content features help on cold-start scenarios for modeling new users or items. So it is essential to utilize content features to enhance different recommendation models. To take full advantage of content features, feature interactions such as cross features are used by some models and outperform than using raw features. However, in real-world systems, many content features are incomplete, e.g., we may know the occupation and gender of a user, but the values of other features (location, interests, etc.) are missing. This missing-feature-value (MFV) problem is harmful to the model performance, especially for models that rely heavily on rich feature interactions. Unfortunately, this problem has not been well studied previously.In this work, we propose a new adaptive "Feature Sampling'' strategy to help train different models to fit distinct scenarios, no matter for cold-start or missing feature value cases. With the help of this strategy, more feature interactions can be utilized. A novel model named CC-CC is proposed. The model takes both raw features and the feature interactions into consideration. It has a linear part to memorize useful variant information from the user or item contents and contexts (Content &amp; Context Module), and a deep attentive neural module that models both content and collaborate information to enhance the generalization ability (Content &amp; Collaborate Module). Both parts have feature interactions. The model is evaluated on two public datasets. Comparative results show that the proposed CC-CC model outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms on both warm and cold scenarios significantly (up to 6.3%).

Existing DG methods mainly learn the representations with invariant marginal distribution of the input features, however, the invariance of the conditional distribution of the labels given the input features is more essential for unknown domain prediction. Meanwhile, the existing of unobserved confounders which affect the input features and labels simultaneously cause spurious correlation and hinder the learning of the invariant relationship contained in the conditional distribution. Interestingly, with a causal view on the data generating process, we find that the input features of one domain are valid instrumental variables for other domains. Inspired by this finding, we propose an instrumental variable-driven DG method (IV-DG) by removing the bias of the unobserved confounders with two-stage learning. In the first stage, it learns the conditional distribution of the input features of one domain given input features of another domain. In the second stage, it estimates the relationship by predicting labels with the learned conditional distribution. Theoretical analyses and simulation experiments show that it accurately captures the invariant relationship. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that IV-DG method yields state-of-the-art results.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Building on these successes, a large number of empirical studies have validated the benefits of the cousin approach called Wasserstein GANs (WGANs), which brings stabilization in the training process. In the present paper, we add a new stone to the edifice by proposing some theoretical advances in the properties of WGANs. First, we properly define the architecture of WGANs in the context of integral probability metrics parameterized by neural networks and highlight some of their basic mathematical features. We stress in particular interesting optimization properties arising from the use of a parametric 1-Lipschitz discriminator. Then, in a statistically-driven approach, we study the convergence of empirical WGANs as the sample size tends to infinity, and clarify the adversarial effects of the generator and the discriminator by underlining some trade-off properties. These features are finally illustrated with experiments using both synthetic and real-world datasets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

ASONAM 2022 was the fourteenth annual conference in the successful ASONAM conferences series and also the first hybrid version of the conference. Previous ASONAM conferences were held in Athens (2009), Odense (2010), Kaohsiung (2011), Istanbul (2012), Niagara Falls (2013), Beijing (2014), Paris (2015), San Francisco (2016), Sydney (2017), Barcelona (2018), Vancouver (2019), Virtual (2020), Virtual (2021). The pre-pandemic locations of the conferences have enabled the participants to enjoy local sights and to engage in person-to-person interactions, making new contacts and form new scientific collaborations. These possibilities were only available in a limited form during the virtual conferences. As the covid pandemic seems to be moving towards an endemic form it was decided to have the conference in the hybrid form, as a move towards normal endemic in-person conferences.For more than a century, social networks have been studied in a variety of disciplines including sociology, anthropology, psychology, and economics. The Internet, the social Web, and other large-scale, sociotechnological infrastructures have triggered a growing interest and resulted in significant methodological advancements in social network analysis and mining. Method development in graph theory, statistics, data mining, machine learning, and AI have inspired new research problems and, in turn, opens up further possibilities for application. These spiraling trends have led to a rising prominence of social network analysis and mining methods and tools in academia, politics, security, and business.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

In addition, it facilitates the monitoring of cases and enriches doctors’ knowledge bases, particularly in decision-making processes. This study includes a comprehensive literature review on personality analysis approaches from social media, aiming to gain a thorough understanding of the current studies on personality therapy. Moreover, the objective of this study is to identify various limitations present in these studies and explore potential avenues for enhancement. More specifically, this research begins with an introduction that discusses the main concepts of traits and personality disorders, as well as the importance of psychological analysis. Following that, four cluster studies related to personality analysis on social media are presented: personality traits, personality disorders, detection of links between diseases, and monitoring patient status. Then, the majority of the currently available works for each cluster are exposed. Afterward, a comparative study of the different presented works is proposed.

Multilingual neural machine translation (MNMT) is a technique for MT that builds a single model for multiple languages. It is preferred over other approaches, since it decreases training time and improves translation in low-resource contexts, i.e., for languages that have insufficient corpus. However, good-quality MT models are yet to be built for many scenarios such as for Indic-to-Indic Languages (IL-IL). Hence, this article is an attempt to address and develop the baseline models for low-resource languages i.e., IL-IL (for 11 Indic Languages (ILs)) in a multilingual environment. The models are built on the Samanantar corpus and analyzed on the Flores-200 corpus. All the models are evaluated using standard evaluation metrics i.e., Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) score (with the range of 0 to 100). This article examines the effect of the grouping of related languages, namely, East Indo-Aryan (EI), Dravidian (DR), and West Indo-Aryan (WI) on the MNMT model. From the experiments, the results reveal that related language grouping is beneficial for the WI group only while it is detrimental for the EI group and it shows an inconclusive effect on the DR group. The role of pivot-based MNMT models in enhancing translation quality is also investigated in this article. Owing to the presence of large good-quality corpora from English (EN) to ILs, MNMT IL-IL models using EN as a pivot are built and examined. To achieve this, English-Indic Language (EN-IL) models are developed with and without the usage of related languages. Results show that the use of related language grouping is advantageous specifically for EN to ILs. Thus, related language groups are used for the development of pivot MNMT models. It is also observed that the usage of pivot models greatly improves MNMT baselines. Furthermore, the effect of transliteration on ILs is also analyzed in this article. To explore transliteration, the best MNMT models from the previous approaches (in most of cases pivot model using related groups) are determined and built on corpus transliterated from the corresponding scripts to a modified Indian language Transliteration script (ITRANS). The outcome of the experiments indicates that transliteration helps the models built for lexically rich languages, with the best increment of BLEU scores observed in Malayalam (ML) and Tamil (TA), i.e., 6.74 and 4.72, respectively. The BLEU score using transliteration models ranges from 7.03 to 24.29.

However, the significant differences in screen size, aspect ratio, and interaction styles make it challenging to adapt Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) across these devices. Although there are millions of apps available on Google Play, only a few thousand are designed to support smart TV displays. Existing techniques to map a mobile app GUI to a TV either adopt a responsive design, which struggles to bridge the substantial gap between phone and TV, or use mirror apps for improved video display, which requires hardware support and extra engineering efforts. Instead of developing another app for supporting TVs, we propose a semi-automated approach to generate corresponding adaptive TV GUIs, given the phone GUIs as the input. Based on our empirical study of GUI pairs for TVs and phones in existing apps, we synthesize a list of rules for grouping and classifying phone GUIs, converting them to TV GUIs, and generating dynamic TV layouts and source code for the TV display. Our tool is not only beneficial to developers but also to GUI designers, who can further customize the generated GUIs for their TV app development. An evaluation and user study demonstrate the accuracy of our generated GUIs and the usefulness of our tool.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| No             |          | The Eyes, the Hands and the Brain: What can Text-to-Image Models Offer for Game Design and Visual Creativity?                                                                                                | Text-to-image models such as DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, and Midjourney have seen a boom in development and adoption in both commercial and hobbyist spaces. This paper is a theoretical analysis aimed at informing the development of games that help improve critical literacy around text-to-image models. It asks: what assumptions and perspectives do text-to-image models have on visual creativity, and how do we bring that out through games? We propose a theory to differentiate between seeing an image through the expression of color, shapes and lines, and seeing an image through the recognition of concepts and ideas. These two ways of seeing are two different ways of orienting the player/user to their visual creativity. While traditional painting mechanics emphasize the former, text-to-image interfaces emphasize the latter. We deploy this perspective to study games with traditional painting interactions and games with text-to-image interactions. This paper hopes to contribute to design both broadly for games about visual creativity, and narrowly for gameplay with text-to-image models — specifically, how the latter fosters a different type of visual creativity than traditional painting interactions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| No             |          | ASPLOS 2023: Proceedings of the 28th ACM International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems, Volume 2                                                         | It is our pleasure to introduce Volume II of ASPLOS ’23. For the first time, ASPLOS has embarked on a new multi-deadline review model. ASPLOS ’23 features 3 deadlines spaced throughout the year and papers will be published in three volumes. Multiple deadlines are meant to encourage authors to submit their papers when ready and to facilitate the selection of some papers for revision. For this volume of ASPLOS ’23, we discontinued the use of the 2-page extended abstract submissions that were used in ASPLOS ’21 and ASPLOS ’22. We found the extended abstract offered limited filtering and moved to a more traditional two phase review process. Each paper received 3 reviews in phase 1 and papers with positive scores advanced to the second round and received up to 2 more reviews.

For the first time, ASPLOS has embarked on a new multi-deadline review model. ASPLOS&nbsp;’23 features 3 deadlines spaced throughout the year and papers will be published in three volumes. Multiple deadlines are meant to encourage authors to submit their papers when ready and to facilitate the selection of some papers for revision. For this volume of ASPLOS&nbsp;’23, we continued the 2-page extended abstract submissions that were used in ASPLOS&nbsp;’21 and ASPLOS&nbsp;’22. We also experimented with a new submission format, where authors were given additional pages but limited to 8000 words in an effort to improve paper readability. In our preface to Volume III, we will give a more detailed rundown of how the process worked.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

For the first time, ASPLOS has embarked on a new multi-deadline review model. ASPLOS&nbsp;’23 featured 3 deadlines spaced throughout the year and published papers in three volumes. Multiple deadlines are meant to encourage authors to submit their papers when ready and to facilitate the selection of some papers for revision.

This study presents the development and evaluation of a Biological Named Entity Recognizer (BNER) using a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) refined through prompt engineering. The BNER was tailored to identify proteins, genes, and small molecules within scientific texts, specifically targeting the context of p53 protein-related research. To assess the BNER's efficacy, we curated a dataset comprising ten paragraphs extracted from the abstracts and significant sections of five high-relevance scientific papers. The system's performance was quantified through an entity recognition task, resulting in 51 true positives (TP), 10 false positives (FP), and 3 false negatives (FN). The BNER achieved an F1 score of 0.887, demonstrating a high degree of precision and recall. These results validate the utility of LLMs in bioinformatics and highlight the BNER's potential to support and accelerate scientific discovery by providing accurate, structured data outputs suitable for comprehensive analysis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Given the intricate symptoms and shifting syndrome patterns, prescribing can be tough for young doctors. TCM prescription recommendations can help these doctors address their experience gap. In recent years, with advancements in technologies such as artificial intelligence and big data, intelligent recommendations for TCM prescriptions have become feasible, holding significant implications for enhancing treatment efficacy and optimizing patient experience. Objective: This study aims to establish a novel TCM prescription recommendation model by integrating large language models with Graph Neural Network (GNN) to enhance the accuracy of prescription suggestions. Method: Based on the co-occurrence of symptoms and herbal medicines, we constructed symptom graphs, symptom-herb graphs, and herb-herb graphs. Using Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), we acquired embeddings for both symptoms and herbs. The symptom embeddings are then integrated with insights from large language model embeddings, while auxiliary information from an external knowledge graph is incorporated into the herb embeddings. A final list of herb recommendations was generated by interacting with the embeddings of symptoms and herbs. Results: The proposed algorithm achieved 22.1%, 17.2%, and 13% on the evaluation metrics P@5, P@10, and P@20, respectively. Concurrently, scores for R@5, R@10, and R@20 were 14%, 24%, and 32.5%, respectively. The P@5 metric surpassed the KDHR by 4.7%, and the R@20 metric exceeded the KDHR by 6%. Overall, the performance of our model outperformed other baseline models across various evaluation criteria. Conclusion: The TCM prescription recommendation model, infused with information from a large language model, can effectively enhance the outcomes of TCM prescription recommendations. The study may offer valuable insights for auxiliary clinical research and treatment in TCM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

This methodology encourages a second-pass processing, allowing for deeper analysis and more refined outputs. We developed a prototype-logic-inspired query optimizer (PQO) to enhance the response of LLM. It refines initial queries using few-shot learning and self-reflection, leading to more insightful questions. Our experimental results show that the proposed approach obtains empirically validated answers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| No             |          | Extracting Domain Models from Textual Requirements in the Era of Large Language Models                                                                                                                       | Requirements Engineering is a critical part of the software lifecycle, describing what a given piece of software will do (functional) and how it will do it (non-functional). Requirements documents are often textual, and it is up to software engineers to extract the relevant domain models from the text, which is an error-prone and time-consuming task. Considering the recent attention gained by Large Language Models (LLMs), we explored how they could support this task. This paper investigates how such models can be used to extract domain models from agile product backlogs and compare them to (i) a state-of-practice tool as well as (ii) a dedicated Natural Language Processing (NLP) approach, on top of a reference dataset of 22 products and 1, 679 user stories. Based on these results, this paper is a first step towards using LLMs and/or tailored NLP to support automated requirements engineering thanks to model extraction using artificial intelligence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

This phenomenon manifests when microorganisms, including bacteria, archaea, and fungi, engage with structural materials, resulting in the degradation of infrastructure and equipment. The accurate prognostication of material microbial corrosion rates is of upmost importance in the formulation of proactive strategies for maintenance and corrosion control. In this study, a novel methodology is introduced, which harnesses the capabilities of XGBoost, an advanced gradient boosting algorithm, for the precise prediction of material microbial corrosion rates. This predictive process is facilitated by employing tabular data that is intricately embedded within a comprehensive large language models (LLMs). The integration of tabular data into the language model yields a sophisticated contextual comprehension of the data, thereby augmenting the model's precision by its aptitude to discern intricate relationships and semantic nuances intrinsic to the tabular data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Early approaches treated sentiment analysis as a document or sentence-level classification problem, lacking the ability to capture nuanced opinions about specific aspects. This limitation was addressed by the development of aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA), which links sentiment to specific aspects that are mentioned explicitly or implicitly in the review. ABSA is relatively a recent field of sentiment analysis and the existing models for ABSA face three main challenges, including domain-specificity, reliance on labeled data, and a lack of exploration into the potential of newer large language models (LLMs) such as GPT, PaLM, and T5. Leveraging a diverse set of datasets, including DOTSA, MAMS, and SemEval16, we evaluate the performance of prominent models such as ATAE-LSTM, flan-t5-large-absa, DeBERTa, PaLM, and GPT-3.5-Turbo. Our findings reveal nuanced strengths and weaknesses of these models across different domains, with DeBERTa emerging as consistently high-performing and PaLM demonstrating remarkable competitiveness for aspect term sentiment analysis (ATSA) tasks. In addition, the PaLM demonstrates competitive performance for all the domains that were used in the experiments including the restaurant, hotel, books, clothing, and laptop reviews. Notably, the analysis underscores the models’ domain sensitivity, shedding light on their varying efficacy for both ATSA and ACSA tasks. These insights contribute to a deeper understanding of model applicability and highlight potential areas for improvement in ABSA research and development.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

In the fields of business and economics, large amounts of research and applications of GPT-based LLMs have been developed and published to automate tasks that mandate advanced human-machine interaction. Nevertheless, there has not been a systematic literature review on GPT-based LLMs in business and economics. To fill this gap, we present our in-progress literature review in this paper focusing on these two related fields. This paper analyzed 30 published research articles and delineated the trends in research, application, prompt engineering and ethical considerations. Our goal is to provide a research framework as well as an application guideline for the fast-growing audience of GPT and LLMs in business and economics. Results of the literature review indicate that many studies are: (1) engaged in creating new applications of GPT-LLM; (2) empirical-qualitative research based on evidenced-oriented data sources; (3) applying diverse methods of prompt engineering; (4) concerned about ethical challenges of GPT-based LLMs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

It provides critical information for healthcare providers to make informed decisions about patient care. However, documenting CCs can be time-consuming for healthcare providers, especially in busy emergency departments. To address this issue, an autocompletion tool that suggests accurate and well-formatted phrases or sentences for clinical notes can be a valuable resource for triage nurses. In this study, we utilized text generation techniques to develop machine learning models using CC data. In our proposed work, we train a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model and fine-tune three different variants of Biomedical Generative Pretrained Transformers (BioGPT), namely microsoft/biogpt, microsoft/BioGPT-Large, and microsoft/BioGPT-Large-PubMedQA. Additionally, we tune a prompt by incorporating exemplar CC sentences, utilizing the OpenAI API of GPT-4. We evaluate the models’ performance based on the perplexity score, modified BERTScore, and cosine similarity score. The results show that BioGPT-Large exhibits superior performance compared to the other models. It consistently achieves a remarkably low perplexity score of 1.65 when generating CC, whereas the baseline LSTM model achieves the best perplexity score of 170. Further, we evaluate and assess the proposed models’ performance and the outcome of GPT-4.0.

| No             |          | Leveraging Large Language Models for Metagenomic Analysis                                                                                                                                                    | Analyzing sequencing data from microbiome experiments is challenging, since samples can contain tens of thousands of unique taxa (and their genes) and populations of millions of cells. Reducing the dimensionality of metagenomic data is a crucial step in improving the interpretability of complex genetic information, as metagenomic datasets typically encompass a wide range of genetic diversity and variations.In this study, we implement RoBERTa, a state-of-the-art large language model, and pre-train it on relatively large genomic datasets to obtain a model that can be used to generate embeddings that can help simplify complex metagenomic data sets. The pre-training process enables RoBERTa to capture the inherent characteristics and patterns present in the genomic sequences. We then evaluate the effectiveness of embeddings generated using the pre-trained RoBERTa model in downstream tasks, with a particular focus on taxonomic classification. To assess whether our method can be generalizable, we conduct extensive downstream analysis on three distinct datasets: 16s rRNA, 28s rRNA, and ITS. By utilizing datasets containing 16S rRNA exclusive to bacteria and eukaryotic mitochondria, as well as datasets containing 28S rRNA and ITS specific to eukaryotes (such as fungi), we were able to assess the performance of RoBERTa embeddings across diverse genomic regions. We tune the RoBERTa model through hyperparameter optimization on each dataset. Our results demonstrate that RoBERTa embeddings exhibit promising results in taxonomic classification compared to conventional methods.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

While large language models like GPT-3 have shown impressive capabilities, they have also prompted questions of fairness, transparency, and ethics. The “FairTransLing” approach contains features to improve interpretability, bias reduction, fairness evaluation, transparency, regulatory compliance, and real-time monitoring, and is proposed as a solution to these problems. The state-of-the-art and time-tested approaches “Interpret ML,” “Fair ML,” “BERT Viz,” “FairGAN,” “LIME,” and “AIF360” were tested against FairTransLing in great detail. We compared these strategies based on six criteria: improved interpretability, reduced bias, increased fairness, improved transparency and fairness, more regulatory compliance, and continuous monitoring. The suggested strategy performed better than the conventional approaches in every respect. Our results demonstrate that FairTransLing provides a complete approach to increase interpretability, eliminate biases, and measure fairness in AI decision-making. Ethical problems and possible biases are reduced because of its emphasis on openness, regulatory compliance, and real-time monitoring.

In this paper, we aim to harness the strong reasoning capability of LLMs toward explainable medical diagnosis. As we know, deep learning has been widely adopted and shown improvement in medical diagnostics. However, it is often criticized for its lack of interpretability. To address this drawback, we propose the first method that innovatively combines Markov logic networks (MLNs) with external knowledge extracted using LLMs, aiming for improved both interpretability and accuracy. Specifically, our approach involves a new process, powered by LLMs and a search engine, to automatically collect and organize external medical knowledge. The outcome is a set of first-order logic (FOL) rules, which then become a key component for the following MLN-based diagnostic algorithm. The resulting MLN-based model can maintain the accuracy of deep networks while providing understandable reasoning for its decisions. By aiming to blend specific knowledge from the medical domain with LLM techniques, our work contributes towards the development of improved automatic diagnosis systems, with the potential for enhancing transparency and trust in medical diagnostics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Economic experiments are essential methods in economics where the behaviors of participants are observed under controlled conditions to test hypotheses and theories, involving significant time, effort, and cost. If a simulation can supplant economic experiments, researchers can overcome these limitations by utilizing it. We focused on three essential factors for applying the simulation using LLMs to economic experiments and conducted simulations for both the proposer and responder sides of the one-shot ultimatum game in various settings of the three factors. The sensitivity analysis revealed that, on the proposer side, there was a setting that produced results similar to actual human-centered experiments. However, on the responder side, none of the simulation setups yielded results consistent with real-world experimental data. These findings suggest both the potential and limitations of the novel simulation with LLMs as a substitute for economic experiments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

In this paper, we propose a new method that uses large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-based Models, to improve QDA, in Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) studies as an example, by automating keypoints extraction and relevance evaluation. Experimental results on the IBM-ArgKP-2021 dataset show improved performance of the new method over existing work, achieving higher accuracy while reducing time and effort in the coding process of QDA, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in various application settings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

"Intervista," an award-winning Italian film by Federico Fellini, focuses on his interview with a Japanese TV crew. Inspired by this, we conducted interviews with a diverse set of open-source and OpenAI models to explore various political, economic, and cultural aspects of life, evaluating LLM performance. We also examined whether a correlation exists between a country’s GDP per capita and the quality of the model’s answers. To this end, we utilized a Huggingface model leaderboard to select appropriate models and deployed them in an AWS SageMaker GPU environment. The identical questions were posed about nearly 200 countries, and the responses were analyzed to verify their accuracy and correlation with Gross Domestic Product (GDP). We were amazed by the diversity, quantity, and quality of existing pretrained open-source LLMs. Our journey provided insights into model selection, inference pipeline automation, GPU configuration, generated texts benchmarking, and systematic evaluation of model quality. Overall, leading LLMs performed well, providing reasonable responses for many countries. However, we discovered that the depth and detail of the answers were influenced by a country’s GDP per capita, with higher-income nations receiving more accurate responses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

However, their performance in specialized fields like medicine often falls short due to the lack of domain-specific knowledge during pre-training. While fine-tuning on labeled medical data is a common approach for task adaptation, it may not capture the comprehensive medical knowledge required. In this paper, we proposed a Hybrid Granularity Mask Learning (HGM) method for domain adaptation in the medical field. Our method incorporates multi-level linguistic characteries including token, entity, and subsentence to enable the model to acquire medical knowledge comprehensively. We fine-tune a medical-specific language model derived from ChatGLM-6B and Bloom-7B on downstream medical tasks and evaluate its performance. The results demonstrate a significant improvement compared to the baseline, thus affirming the effectiveness of our proposed method.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| No             |          | Enhanced Identification of Care Preference Documentation in Patients' Discharge Summaries Using Pre-Trained Large Language Models                                                                            | Improving patient-centered care necessitates accurate documentation of care preferences, a crucial aspect often underrepresented in administrative data. Most studies apply care documentation to specific patient populations, rather than the more appropriately broad population of ‘seriously ill’ patients. This study addresses this gap, first by matching decedent patients to non-decedent counterparts by using propensity score matching, accounting for important variables like age, gender, primary diagnoses, and patient co-morbidities, and then by leveraging transformer-based machine learning models, exhibiting an improvement over traditional keyword-based search methods. We trained and fine-tuned Bio_ClinicalBERT and ClinicalLong-former models on a large dataset of patient discharge summaries, enhancing their signal-to-noise ratio by focusing on key textual aspects, thereby capturing contextually nuanced mentions of care preference documentation. These models demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity compared to industry-standard keyword-search methods, proving adept at interpreting complex clinical concepts. This study highlights the potential of transformer-based models specifically trained for clinical domain tasks.

This has been intensified by the release of ChatGPT which allows anyone to interact in a simple conversational way with LLMs, without any experience in the field needed. As a result, ChatGPT has been rapidly applied to many different tasks such as code- and song-writer, education, virtual assistants, etc., showing impressive results for tasks for which it was not trained (zero-shot learning). The present study aims to explore the ability of ChatGPT, based on the recent GPT-4 multimodal LLM, for the task of face biometrics. In particular, we analyze the ability of ChatGPT to perform tasks such as face verification, soft-biometrics estimation, and explainability of the results. ChatGPT could be very valuable to further increase the explainability and transparency of automatic decisions in human scenarios. Experiments are carried out in order to evaluate the performance and robustness of ChatGPT, using popular public benchmarks and comparing the results with state-of-the-art methods in the field. The results achieved in this study show the potential of LLMs such as ChatGPT for face biometrics, especially to enhance explainability.

The quality of the systems surprised and delighted many with both a flurry of lawsuits, predictions of the collapse of many white collar careers, and decimation of artist incomes. The potential to have an interactive tool that can work like an interactive textbook is compelling and potentially transformative for the betterment of humanity offering low cost access to something to talk with about just about anything. This can enable learning to whole new audiences. With this potential upside, the current status of these tools in terms of the economics of the tools themselves, how their costs compare to human labor, the impacts on human jobs both white collar and creative, and in the current legal environment must be considered to best see the future these tools may offer. This work examines what these tools are, how they work, and the implications of how they are created through all of these lenses to give a holistic view of the current state and potential future possibilities. While this is a changing landscape, the current status can offer a strong position to talk about these tools and help guide what the future will be like.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

While previous studies primarily focused on factual and objective questions with explicit or implicit answers in the text, this research concentrates on automatically generating subjective questions to directly elicit personal preference from individuals based on a given text. The research methodology involves the application of fine-tuning techniques across multiple iterations of flan-T5 and GPT3 architectures for the task of Seq2Seq generation. This approach is meticulously evaluated using a custom dataset comprising 40,000 news articles along with human-generated questions. Furthermore, a comparative analysis is conducted using zero-shot prompting via GPT-3.5, juxtaposing the performance of fine-tuned models against a significantly larger language model. The study grapples with the inherent challenges tied to evaluating opinion-based question generation due to its subjective nature and the inherent uncertainty in determining answers. A thorough investigation and comparison of two transformer architectures are undertaken utilizing conventional lexical overlap metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR, alongside semantic similarity metrics encompassing BERTScore, BLEURT, and answerability scores such as QAScore, and RQUGE. The findings underscore the marked superiority of the flan-T5 model over GPT3, substantiated not only by quantitative metrics but also through human evaluations. The paper introduces Opinerium based on the open-source flan-T5-Large model, identified as the pacesetter in generating subjective questions. Additionally, we assessed all aforementioned metrics thoroughly by investigating the pairwise Spearman correlation analysis to identify robust metrics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

In recent years, deep learning techniques have been shown to be effective in classifying radiology reports. This article investigates the use of deep learning techniques with attention mechanisms to achieve better performance in the classification of radiology reports. We focus on various Natural Language Processing approaches, such as LSTM with Attention, BERT, and GPT-4, evaluated on a chest tomography report dataset regarding neoplastic diseases collected from an Italian hospital. In particular, we compare the results with a previous machine learning system, showing that models based on attention mechanisms can achieve higher performance. The Attention Mechanism allows us to identify the most relevant bits of text used by the model to make its predictions. We show that our model achieves state-of-the-art results on the hierarchical classification of radiology reports. Moreover, we evaluate the performance of GPT-4 on the classification of these reports in a zero-shot setup through prompt engineering, showing interesting results even with a small context and a non-English language. Our findings suggest that deep learning techniques with attention mechanisms may be successful in the classification of radiology reports even in non-English languages for which it is not possible to leverage on large text corpus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Conversational Agents, such as Smart home Personal Assistants, have shown promise in fostering sustainable behaviors in domestic environments. However, traditional conversations with rule-based approaches in such agents face challenges in addressing users' questions in complex domains like sustainability. Large Language Models (LLMs) are a promising tool to overcome these limitations of their capability to answer open-domain questions. The final objective of this work is to compare the generative capabilities of four large language models in ecological sustainability to determine the most suitable LLM to be embedded into home assistants and create a hybrid model of conversational agent for environmental sustainability. We performed two evaluations. In the former, we constructed a set of trustable sources on the topic and analyzed the extent to which the themes covered in the text generated by the models appeared in it. The results do not show a statistical difference between the outputs of the candidate models, while qualitative analysis determined that ChatGPT, at the moment, is the optimal solution. In the second evaluation, we tested the responses generated by ChatGPT on a corpus of 167 questions from a sample of 75 people. Responses evaluation was performed by a team of experts (N=5) on fluency, coherency, consistency, accuracy, and reasoning.

LLMs, exemplified by models like GPT-3, GPT-4, or Galactica, have demonstrated extraordinary aptitude for under-standing and generating human-like text. What makes OpenAI's GPT-3 models and beyond stand out is their impressive per-formance using in-context learning, allowing them to effectively tackle tasks with minimal examples or context. This adaptability highlights GPT-3's versatility, making it a dominant force in various NLP applications. However, recent studies have revealed certain limitations and weaknesses in GPT-3, particularly in more specific domains, such as the biomedical field, where it exhibits lower performance under few-shot settings in tasks like named entity recognition (NER) or question answering (QA) compared to smaller language models. Thus, this paper aims to fine-tune GPT-3 as a general-purpose language model using biomedical data and assess its performance across seven different biomedical natural language processing tasks: named entity recognition, relation extraction, question answering, document classification, relation classification, text similarity, and molecular property prediction. We demonstrate that the fine-tuned GPT-3 models excel in tasks such as question answering and document classi-fication while lagging behind state-of-the-art models in others. These results prompt significant consideration of the potential benefits of fine-tuning, pre-training with domain-specific data, or even augmenting the model to improve overall performance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

In this work, we re-visit this assumption and carry out an investigation in clinical NLP, specifically Named Entity Recognition (NER) on drugs and their related attributes. We compare Transformer models that are trained from scratch to fine-tuned BERT-based Large Language Models (LLMs) namely BERT, BioBERT, and ClinicalBERT. Furthermore, we examine the impact of an additional Conditional Random Field (CRF) layer on such models to encourage contextual learning. We use n2c2-2018 shared task data for model development and evaluations. The experimental outcomes show that 1) CRF layers improved all language models; 2) referring to BIO-strict span level evaluation using macro-average F1 score, although the fine-tuned LLMs achieved 0.83+ scores, the TransformerCRF model trained from scratch achieved 0.78+, demonstrating comparable performances with much lower cost, e.g. with 39.80% less training parameters; 3) referring to BIO-strict span-level evaluation using weighted-average F1 score, ClinicalBERT-CRF, BERT-CRF, and TransformerCRF exhibited lower score differences, with 97.59%/97.44%/96.84% respectively. 4) applying efficient training by down-sampling for better data distribution further reduced the training cost and need for data, while maintaining similar scores -i.e. around 0.02 points lower compared to using the full dataset.

This research aims to harness the potential of Electronic Health Records (EHRs), particularly unstructured clinical notes, as a rich data source for cancer symptom information. Given the complexity of extracting information from EHRs, we investigate the performance of various Large Language Models (LLMs), such as (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) BERT and its variants, for cancer symptom identification. Using a carefully curated dataset of 1112 clinical notes annotated by experts for 13 prevalent cancer symptoms, we present a comparative analysis of the performance of models including BERT-based, Span BERT, Bio BERT, Clinical BERT, and PubMed BERT. Our findings unequivocally show that Clinical BERT outperforms other models, especially in metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score. This dominance of Clinical BERT underscores its potential to revolutionize cancer symptom management through EHRs, hinting at a brighter future for oncological research and improved treatment decision-making.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Specifically, Tuberculosis and its symptoms are selected as the test case and our evaluation follows the directions of (i) medical validity and accuracy of the returned diagnosis in terms of both context and references, (ii) its usefulness to both doctors and patients and (iii) the economic value added to the healthcare system. It is shown that ChatGPT performs well in diagnosing Tuberculosis, but its performance improves when supervised by a human medical expert. In the interest of adding reproducibility and comparability, we propose a novel general evaluation procedure for the medical domain, to be followed when interacting with Large Language Models. This procedure integrates the various steps employed in our evaluation process and encompasses the review indices utilized for quantifying the outcome.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Unfortunately, we find that the same improved capabilities amplify the dual-use risks for malicious purposes of these models. Dual-use is difficult to prevent as instruction-following capabilities now enable standard attacks from computer security. The capabilities of these instruction-following LLMs provide strong economic incentives for dual-use by malicious actors. In particular, we show that instruction-following LLMs can produce targeted malicious content, including hate speech and scams, bypassing in-the-wild defenses implemented by LLM API vendors. Our analysis shows that this content can be generated economically and at cost of $125-500 \\times$ cheaper than human effort alone. Together, our findings suggest that LLMs will increasingly attract more sophisticated adversaries and attacks, and addressing these attacks may require new approaches to mitigations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

However, the boundaries of the SI concepts are becoming blurry and shifting due to technological and economic factors, globalization and interdependence between countries and firms. Previous literature has limitations to address shifting boundaries by assessing SI literature holistically. This study set out to understand the overlaps of SI concepts. It aims at delimiting the SI field, delineating boundaries and at determining the topics underlying the SI and overlaps. Context-specific synergies become transparent, enabling decision-makers and researchers to consider economic interrelationships in a topic-specific and cross-system perspective. The study uses deep learning in combination with natural language processing on data consisting of 2380 SI literature related article abstracts retrieved from Web of Science and EBSCO research databases to capture the semantic context of topics, whereas external information is used to cross-validate interrelationships and to observe topic distribution. The findings reveal significant proportions of overlaps between SI apart from regional and technological systems. Various topics that are discussed within the SI literature such as industrial clusters and structures is a common topic for all SI. This illustrates that economic topics are contextually or theoretically not bound to a system but distributed across the entire literature. We therefore provide a structured framework to illustrate SI overlaps and to address topic synergies. Our study contributes to the body of literature where SI boundaries are investigated specifically to the determination of system overlaps, reasoning of their identical SI characteristics and examination of cross-system thematic synergies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Automated log analysis is a critical task in AIOps as it provides key insights for SREs to identify and address ongoing faults. Tasks such as log format detection, log classification, and log parsing are key components of automated log analysis. Most of these tasks require supervised learning; however, there are multiple challenges due to limited labeled log data and the diverse nature of log data. Large Language Models (LLMs) such as BERT and GPT3 are trained using self-supervision on a vast amount of unlabeled data. These models provide generalized representations that can be effectively used for various downstream tasks with limited labeled data. Motivated by the success of LLMs in specific domains like science and biology, this paper introduces a LLM for log data which is trained on public and proprietary log data. Results of our experiments demonstrate that the proposed LLM outperforms existing models on multiple downstream tasks. In summary, AIOps powered by LLMs offers an efficient and effective solution for automating log analysis tasks and enabling SREs to focus on higher-level tasks. Our proposed LLM, trained on public and proprietary log data, offers superior performance on multiple downstream tasks, making it a valuable addition to the AIOps platform.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

This article proposes a Transformer-based unified framework, VistaGPT, to address these challenges. VistaGPT, composed of Modular Federations of Vehicular Transformers (M-FoV) and Automated Composing of Autonomous Driving Systems (AutoAuto), aims to overcome the information barriers due to system-level and module-level heterogeneity. M-FoV collects and organizes Transformer-based models in a modular fashion to facilitate system integration by providing diversity and versatility. AutoAuto utilizes large language models (LLMs) to automatically compose end-to-end autonomous driving systems with a “Dividing and Recombining” strategy. Besides, we deploy Scenario Engineering systems to evaluate the composed systems and provide systematic feedback for the optimization of AutoAuto, and Federated intelligence to contribute to diverse training samples and applications. With its capacity, scalability, and diversity, VistaGPT provides a new paradigm of LLM-aided system development for transport automation, which promotes virtual-real interactive parallel driving and advances progress toward “6S” objectives.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

While large-scale language models perform prominently in the general domain, even surpassing human performance in certain aspects, challenges such as data privacy and the massive training costs affect the broader adoption of LLMs in biomedical domain. This study explores the strategies of efficient fine-tuning and optimization methods in biomedical domain. We introduce a multi-stage fine-tuning strategy that improves the accuracy of medical question-answering tasks significantly. Specifically, a contrastive learning technique based on multi-prompts is proposed, and a self-consistency voting approach is used to improve the accuracy of reasoning-required tasks. Experimental results on PubMedQA dataset reveal that even fine-tuning only 0.152% of the baseline’s parameters, our method still improves its performance, making it outperform the domain-specific pre-trained models and achieve performance comparable to GPT-4.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Unfortunately, real-time conversations are difficult to scale, losing effectiveness in groups above 4 to 7 members. Conversational Swarm Intelligence (CSI) is a new technology that enables large human groups to hold real-time conversations using techniques modeled on the dynamics of biological swarms. Through a novel use of Large Language Models (LLMs), CSI enables real-time dialog among small groups while simultaneously fostering content propagation across a much larger group. This combines the benefits of small-scale deliberative reasoning and large-scale groupwise intelligence. In this study, we engage a group of 81 American voters from one political party in real-time deliberation using a CSI platform called Thinkscape. We then task the group with (a) forecasting which candidate from a set of options will achieve the most national support, and (b) indicating the specific reasons for this result. After only six minutes of deliberation, the group of 81 individuals converged on a selected candidate and surfaced over 400 reasons justifying various candidates, including 206 justifications that supported the selected candidate. We find that the selected candidate was significantly more supported by group members than the other options (p<0.001) and that this effect held even after six minutes of deliberation, demonstrating that CSI provides both the qualitative benefits of conversational focus groups and the quantitative benefits of largescale polling.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| No             |          | Gaze and Head Movement Patterns of Depressive Symptoms During Conversations with Emotional Virtual Humans                                                                                                    | Depressive symptoms involve dysfunctional social attitudes and heightened negative emotional states. Identifying biomarkers requires data collection in realistic environments that activate depression-specific phenomena. However, no previous research analysed biomarkers in combination with AI-powered conversational virtual humans (VH) for mental health assessment. This study aims to explore gaze and head movements patterns related to depressive symptoms during conversations with emotional VH. A total of 105 participants were evenly divided into a control group and a group of subjects with depressive symptoms (SDS). They completed six semi-guided conversations designed to evoke basic emotions. The VHs were developed using a cognitive-inspired framework, enabling real-time voice-based conversational interactions powered by a Large Language Model, and including emotional facial expressions and lip synchronization. They have embedded life-history, context, attitudes, emotions and motivations. Signal processing techniques were applied to obtain gaze and head movements features, and heatmaps were generated. Then, parametric and non-parametric statistical tests were applied to evaluate differences between groups. Additionally, a two-dimensional t-SNE embedding was created and combined with k-means clustering. Results indicate that SDS exhibited shorter blinks and longer saccades. The control group showed affiliative lateral head gyros and accelerations, while the SDS demonstrated stress-related back-and-forth movements. SDS also displayed the avoidance of eye contact. The exploratory multivariate statistical unsupervised learning achieved 72.3% accuracy. The present study analyse biomarkers in affective processes with multiple social contextual factors and information modalities in ecological environments, and enhances our understanding of gaze and head movements patterns in individuals with depressive symptoms, ultimately contributing to the development of more effective assessments and intervention strategies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Likewise, finding and arranging research papers with a keyword is also exhausting. This paper aims to automate such exhausting processes while working with research papers. This automation is done using a Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique: Question Answering System. The paper introduces benchmark data for developing such a Question Answering system finetuned for biomedical research papers. The data is developed by the annotation of question, context, and answer pairs from biomedical research papers from Pubmed. Applying transfer learning to this benchmark data on several pretrained large language models such as BERT, RoBERTa, PubmedBERT and BioBERT, the paper introduces a state-of-the-art model for such biomedical question-answering data. The model developed by finetuning this custom data on PubmedBERT released by Microsoft achieved an Exact Match of 83.89 and an F-score of 89.67.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| No             |          | Chat2Brain: A Method for Mapping Open-Ended Semantic Queries to Brain Activation Maps                                                                                                                        | Over decades, neuroscience has accumulated a wealth of research results in the text modality that can be used to explore cognitive processes. Meta-analysis is a typical method that successfully establishes a link from text queries to brain activation maps using these research results, but it still relies on an ideal query environment. In practical applications, text queries used for meta-analyses may encounter issues such as semantic redundancy and ambiguity, resulting in an inaccurate mapping to brain images. On the other hand, large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have shown great potential in tasks such as context understanding and reasoning, displaying a high degree of consistency with human natural language. Hence, LLMs could improve the connection between text modality and neuroscience, resolving existing challenges of meta-analyses. In this study, we propose a method called Chat2Brain that combines LLMs to basic text-2-image model, known as Text2Brain, to map open-ended semantic queries to brain activation maps in data-scarce and complex query environments. By utilizing the understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLMs, the performance of the mapping model is optimized by transferring text queries to semantic queries. We demonstrate that Chat2Brain can synthesize anatomically plausible neural activation patterns for more complex tasks of text queries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Actual device descriptions are taken and matched with the device description in FDA Title 21 of CFR to determine their corresponding device type. Both pre-trained word embeddings such as FastText and large pre-trained sentence embedding models such as sentence transformers are evaluated on their accuracy in characterizing a piece of device description. An experiment is also done to test whether these models can identify the devices wrongly classified in the FDA database. The result shows that sentence transformer with T5 and MPNet and GPT-3 semantic search embedding show high accuracy in identifying the correct classification by narrowing down the correct label to be contained in the first 15 most likely results, as compared to 2585 types of device descriptions that must be manually searched through. On the other hand, all methods demonstrate high accuracy in identifying completely incorrectly labeled devices, but all fail to identify false device classifications that are wrong but closely related to the true label.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

In this study, we utilized the E-DAIC (Extended Distress Analysis Interview Corpus-Wizard-of-Oz) dataset, an extended version of the DAIC-WOZ dataset, which consists of semi-clinical interviews conducted by an animated virtual interviewer called Ellie, controlled by a human interviewer in another room. With 275 participants, the E-DAIC dataset represents a valuable resource for investigating depression detection methods. Our aim is to predict PHQ-8 scores through text analysis. Leveraging state-of-the-art speech processing, LLM-based text summarization, and a specialized depression detection module, we demonstrate the transformative potential of language data analysis in enhancing depression screening. By overcoming the limitations of manual feature extraction methods, our automated techniques provide a more efficient and effective means of evaluating depression. In our evaluation, we achieve robust accuracy on the development set of the E-DAIC dataset, with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 3.65 in estimating PHQ-8 scores from recorded interviews. This remarkable performance highlights the efficacy of our approach in automatically predicting depression severity. Our research contributes to the growing evidence supporting the use of LLMs in mental health assessment, showcasing the role of innovative technologies in advancing patient care for depression.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| No             |          | Dual Layer Cogni - Insight Deep-Mood Encoder: A Two- Tiered Approach for Depression Detection                                                                                                                | Depression (MDD) affects approximately 5% of adults globally, contributing to productivity loss and public health concerns. With 280 million people impacted, the risk of suicide and self-harm underscores its severity. Current treatments are inadequate, and the complex, heterogeneous nature of depression necessitates automated solutions for timely assessment and varied treatments. This study explores the transformative role of Artificial Intelligence in detecting depressive symptoms, leveraging NLP, and multimodal data analysis. The research introduces the “Dual Layer Cogni-Insight Deep-Mood Encoder (DLCDME)” model, incorporating two-tiered feature encodings. Four pre-trained language models (BERT, MentalBERT, MentalRoBERTa, PsychBERT, and ClinicalBERT) are experimented and fused with linguistic features for comprehensive representation. A transformer encoder, multi-head attention, and LSTM fine-tuning enhances contextual text feature embeddings, demonstrating the efficacy of ClinicalBERT with transformer encoders for cost-effective large corpus handling. Contributions include a novel feature extraction approach, a thorough model analysis, and the superior performance of DLCDME over contemporary works, holding promise for clinical diagnosis. Our findings reveal that a) the application of ClinicalBERT over DLCDME significantly enhances the performance of depression detection, and b) employing dual feature encodings on text data with transformer attention for predicting depression yields an improved MAE of 3.40 and RMSE of 4.38. The model achieved a test accuracy of 95%, with F1 scores for precision, and recall recorded at 0.95, 0.96, 0.95 respectively.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. In the first part we cover five current specific challenges through examples: (1) discrimination (e.g., facial recognition, justice, sharing economy, language models); (2) phrenology (e.g., biometric based predictions); (3) unfair digital commerce (e.g., exposure and popularity bias); (4) stupid models (e.g., Signal, minimal adversarial AI) and (5) indiscriminated use of computing resources (e.g., large language models). These examples do have a personal bias but set the context for the second part where we address four generic challenges: (1) too many principles (e.g., principles vs. techniques), (2) cultural differences (e.g., Christian vs. Muslim); (3) government regulation (e.g., privacy, antitrust) and (4) our cognitive biases. We finish discussing what we can do to address these challenges in the near future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| No             |          | Effectiveness of Generative Artificial Intelligence for Scientific Content Analysis                                                                                                                          | Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in general, and large language models (LLMs) in particular, are highly fashionable. As they have the ability to generate coherent output based on prompts in natural language, they are promoted as tools to free knowledge workers from tedious tasks such as content writing, customer support and routine computer code generation. Unsurprisingly, their application is also attractive to professionals in the research domain, where mundane and laborious tasks, such as literature screening, are commonplace. We evaluate Vertex AI ‘text-bison’, a foundational LLM model, in a real-world academic scenario by replicating parts of a popular systematic review in the information management domain. By comparing the results of a zero-shot LLM-based approach with those of the original study, we gather evidence on the suitability of state-of-the-art general-purpose LLMs for the analysis of scientific content. We show that the LLM-based approach delivers good scientific content analysis performance for a general classification problem (ACC =0.9), acceptable performance for a domain-specific classification problem (ACC =0.8) and borderline performance for a text comprehension problem (ACC ≈0.69). We conclude that some content analysis tasks with moderate accuracy requirements may be supported by current LLMs. As the technology will evolve rapidly in the foreseeable future, studies on large corpora, where some inaccuracies are tolerable, or workflows that prepare large data sets for human processing, may increasingly benefit from the capabilities of GenAI.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

DistilBERT is a smaller, more efficient version of BERT, but it can still be too large for deployment on devices with limited memory and computational resources. Model compression techniques can be used to reduce the size and improve the inference time of LLMs, but this can often lead to a decrease in model performance. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to fine-tuning DistilBERT with model compression techniques while maintaining or even improving model performance. We use a combination of pruning and quantization methods to reduce the model size and improve inference time. We also introduce a new training regime that is specifically designed for fine-tuning compressed DistilBERT models. We evaluated our approach on sentiment analysis. Our results show that we can achieve significant model compression and inference time improvements without sacrificing model performance. For example, on the YouTube comment sentiment analysis task, we were able to reduce the model size by 50% and improve the inference time by 25%, while maintaining the same accuracy as the original DistilBERT model. Our findings suggest that our approach is a promising way to develop NLP models that are suitable for resource-constrained environments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

LLMs imitate human writing patterns to produce highly natural text, raising serious ethical, moral, legal, social, and economic concerns in various industries. To address these issues, we present two methods to distinguish Synthetically Generated Text (SGT) from Human-Written Text (HWT): machine learning and text similarity. Our methods include procedures for dataset creation, feature engineering, model training, and result analysis with feature importance analysis and explanation models. As part of our research, we created two datasets - a Wikipedia-based and a US Election 2024 news article-based dataset using ChatGPT, from which we obtained promising results of up to 99.xxx% accuracy. These datasets can be used as open-source datasets in future studies. We also identified a set of handcrafted features that can serve as the baseline feature set for future research.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Large-scale language models have been applied in various fields and played an important role in many aspects. Large language models can also perform financial and technical analysis by cleaning data, generating synthetic data, handling bias, and supporting natural language queries. This paper proposes a language model that integrates multimodal data with external knowledge bases and domain-specific data, enhancing its reasoning ability by extending domain-specific data. Reduce hallucinations and fine-tune domain-specific data by incorporating external knowledge bases to deepen model understanding of industry-specific language, concepts, and context. And technologies such as knowledge graph, attention mechanism, cross-modal embedding and federated collaborative training are used to deal with the challenges of different structures and semantics of multi-modal data. The model also employs a feedback loop mechanism to allow the model to adapt to changing conditions, such as changing languages or new domain information. Experimental results show that the proposed model has a preliminary domain-specific ability to analyze and predict multimodal financial and technical data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

The existing methods usually apply oversampling to solve the problems caused by the unbalanced distribution and limited knowledge of the datases, which may ignore the sample diversity. In addition, they usually encode the text by the pre-trained language model BioBERT, which can only obtain context information of the text and may limit the performance because of the insufficiently extracted text information. To solve the above mentioned problems, in this paper, we propose a Multi-source Knowledge Fusion Network (MKFN) to augment data as well as sufficiently extract and fuse the text information and the external knowledge for biomedical causal relation extraction. Specifically, we apply the large language model Roberta to augment samples in minority classes and filter the external knowledge from multiple knowledge bases with the relevance of the text to triples captured by the structure information. Afterward, the multi-source knowledge embedding including context information, structure information and the corresponding external knowledge is acquired by various different encoders. Additionally, we utilize the triplet attention, which is introduced into event relation extraction for the first time, to fuse the multi-source knowledge embedding. Extensive experimental results on Hahn-Powell’s and BioCause datasets confirm that the proposed method achieves novel state-of-the-art performance compared with the current advances.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

However, the training and deployment of large language models involve high-resource computing, posing a challenge for many small or edge devices in the Internet of Things (IoT). Therefore, in the context of IoT edge consumer electronic devices, deploying question-and-answer models based on TinyML becomes more meaningful. In this paper, we propose a tiny deep learning-based Question-Answer scheme to realize end-to-end dialog service by Machine Reading Comprehension. In order to obtain semantic representation, we design and apply a pre-training model to generate the semantic embedding representation of questions and answers and propose a pretraining fine-tuning method based on the twin model. In addition, we also introduce a compression method based on embedded representation and design a forward compression network and a cyclic compression network based on an encoder. The experimental results show that our method is more accurate than state-of-the-art schemes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

One of the important features in the incremental algorithms such as LOLIMOT is the structure optimization of the model. In this paper, the merging algorithm is used as a supervisor of the original LOLIMOT to overcome suboptimal LLMs. Also, particle swarm optimization is used to obtain the optimal standard deviation of each LLM and leads to have an optimize structure. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed extension of the original LOLIMOT algorithm to have a good precise with optimal number of neurons.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Traditional methods rely on features based on first principles derived from the binding interface. However, they are burdened by arduous data preprocessing from a limited quantity of protein structures. In comparison, deep learning allows automatic substructure characterization and representation without hand-crafted feature engineering. In particular, large language models (LLMs) based method predicts neutralization using Fv sequences of antibody and antigen. Despite LLM’s success, incorporating full-length Fv sequences suffers from: 1) inaccurate sequence-level labels in existing datasets, 2) inefficient modeling due to noisy non-contributing motifs, and 3) ignorance of non-bonded interactions that play a key role in facilitating epitope-paratope pairing. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that incorporates only the paratope and epitope for antibody-antigen neutralization prediction while adopting a novel set modeling that regards the paratope and epitope as bags of residues. Specifically, we hand-crafted a dataset containing neutralizing paratope-epitope pairs where epitopes are potentially generalizable to future unseen variants of SARS-CoV-2. Training on such a dataset enables deep learning models to predict neutralizing antibodies for prospective mutated variants of SARS-CoV-2, meanwhile addressing the problem of inaccurate sequence-level labels. A higher modeling efficiency is also achieved by disregarding non-contributing motifs. Furthermore, we also propose paratope-epitope set interaction (PESI), a set modeling model inspired by first principles that learns intra-inter non-covalent interactions through a global attention mechanism. To validate PESI, we perform a 10-fold cross-validation on our dataset. Experimental results show that PESI achieves a more balanced overall performance and a significant improvement on MCC as compared to existing architectures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Several research has demonstrated the success of ChatGPT in various domains, and its adaptability and versatility make it a valuable tool in the bioinformatics toolbox. ChatGPT's ability to learn and adapt to new data and tasks sets it apart from existing approaches, and its use has the potential to revolutionize how researchers analyze and interpret biological data. ChatGPT, has major applications in scientific literature review and text mining. Research has shown that pre-training GPT like models with biological text has improved the accuracy and reliability of such models when dealing with biological data. Additionally, ChatGPT shows a lot of promise in bioinformatics and has the potential to help a lot of people, due to its ubiquitousness and ease of handling. Major limitations and drawbacks of using ChatGPT involve its inability to handle complex biological data such as genomic data and also a large amount of training data is required to generate accurate results. But with the advancing technologies and development on newer advanced GPT models, can easily provide potential solutions to these limitations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Prediction of Molecular properties is one of the crucial tasks in drug discovery. Bioactivity values (e.g., pIC50 values) are molecular properties commonly used to evaluate and select potential drug candidates. To increase the efficiency in drug discovery, lots of research has been conducted by implementing machine learning to do drug candidate screening. In this study we conduct Large Language Model-based approach by fine-tuning of Transformers Model on Alzheimer's drug candidates to predict their bioactivity, where in earlier research implementation of Random Forest was the gold standard. We conduct fine-tuning on classification and regression tasks. For comparison, we compare the result with QSAR random forest regression and classification model. The experiment result shows that ChemBERTa as a language model has better performances for both regression and classification tasks to predict bioactivity compared to the QSAR Random Forest model. The classification task performed by ChemBERTa obtain auROC and auPRC scores of 0.77 and 0.81, respectively.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

This LLM model recognizes the relationship between the need for operating a base-loaded unit and the system load cycle. A comparison of the results obtained by using a traditional production costing method, the OPCOST method with explicit consideration of unit duty cycle effects, and the new method using the LLM model for base-loaded units, called the PROCOP method, shows significant differences in the energies produced by the base-loaded units and consequently the other units. The linkage of a base-loaded unit's need for operation to the load cycle avoids the assumption of the traditional model that the base-loaded units are equally needed all times. It also avoids the ad hoc treatment of outage postponability of base-loaded units. Hence, the PROCOP method is more physically based and is likely to be more accurately responsive to change in the load cycle and other system parameters.<>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

Nonlinear dynamic systems like CR are not so easy to model and engineers have often struggled to find the best solution to approximate the input-output dependencies. NeuroFuzzy networks, combined with LLM, are powerful tools for splitting an input space into smaller pieces where the linear approximations are considered satisfactory. Using appropriate numerical models, these architectures can be implemented in a real-time environment with a moderate effort but a new challenge arises: real time adapting of the linear models parameters. The paper illustrates that the LLMs, and hence, the whole dynamic models parameters of the CR's NeuroFuzzy developed architecture, can be adapted for a wide working space. The practical final results are favorable. The solution may result in lower emissions with favorable economic and environmental implications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Natural language processing (NLP) can offer help in the form of early detection and frequent assessments. However, such technology is still limited in the local Malaysian context. In this paper we aimed to deploy Malay NLP in the local mental healthcare services. We performed depression detection on dialectal Malay speeches, specifically Kuala Lumpur, Pahang, and Terengganu dialects. Generative Pre-Trained Transformer-3 (GPT-3), a large language model, was used to perform the task. We experimented with different hyperparameters to test the capability of GPT-3 in few-shot learning. The results obtained are promising considering the size of our dataset that is very limited. We hope to see more studies in the field for the better development of Malay NLP in future.

The final stage of this study involves rigorous testing of the designed chassis to assess its mechanical performance, guided by the stringent benchmarks set by the competition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Transformer-based models have attained innovative results on numerous NLP benchmarks in linguistics. Researchers have also investigated transformer models for a variety of applications in the biomedical field. To facilitate information classification, this work aims to thoroughly investigate four state-of-the-art transformer-based models (BERT, Roberta, SciBERT, and ClinicalBERT). Large language model training, however, requires a lot of time and processing resources. As a result, pre-trained language models like BERT are advantageous because they (1) offer cutting-edge performance, (2) The knowledge gained can be used to do several tasks, such as categorization, and (3) free up practitioners from having to gather enough resources (including the hardware, data and time) to train models. However, pre-trained models possibly will perform poorly in some domains since they are generic. Here, we inspect the case of multilabel classification for biomedical Literature, which is a domain that has received relatively minor attention in the literature assessing pre-trained language models. Based on our study, using SciBERT as the baseline model gave the best results compared to the rest of the models with an 89.35% micro F1 score. In the context of classifying Biomedical Literature, domain-specific pre-trained models tend to perform better compared to generic models.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

Underwater and surface vehicles equipped with machine learning algorithms can help to accurately estimate the composition and extent of seagrass meadows at scale. However, previous approaches for seagrass detection and classification have required supervision from patch-level labels. In this paper, we reframe seagrass classification as a weakly supervised coarse segmentation problem where image-level labels are used during training (25 times fewer labels compared to patch-level labeling) and patch-level outputs are obtained at inference time. To this end, we introduce SeaFeats, an architecture that uses unsupervised contrastive pre-training and feature similarity, and SeaCLIP, a model that showcases the effectiveness of large language models as a supervisory signal in domain-specific applications. We demonstrate that an ensemble of SeaFeats and SeaCLIP leads to highly robust performance. Our method outperforms previous approaches that require patch-level labels on the multi-species ‘DeepSeagrass’ dataset by 6.8% (absolute) for the class-weighted F1 score, and by 12.1% (absolute) for the seagrass presence/absence F1 score on the ‘Global Wetlands’ dataset. We also present two case studies for real-world deployment: outlier detection on the Global Wetlands dataset, and application of our method on imagery collected by the FloatyBoat autonomous surface vehicle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

However, for an artificial intelligence (AI) to truly evolve, it needs to possess a physical “body” to transition from the virtual world to the real world and evolve through interaction with the real environments. In this context, “embodied intelligence” has sparked a new wave of research and technology, leading AI beyond the digital realm into a new paradigm that can actively act and perceive in a physical environment through tangible entities such as robots and automated devices [5].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

The requirements that serve as the foundation for these intricate systems are still primarily expressed in Natural Language (NL), which can contain ambiguities and inconsistencies and suffer from a lack of structure that hinders their direct translation into models. The colossal developments in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), in general, and Large Language Models (LLMs), in particular, can serve as an enabler for the conversion of NL requirements into machine-readable requirements. Doing so is expected to facilitate their standardization and use in a model-based environment. This paper discusses a two-fold strategy for converting NL requirements into machine-readable requirements using language models. The first approach involves creating a requirements table by extracting information from free-form NL requirements. The second approach consists of an agile methodology that facilitates the identification of boilerplate templates for different types of requirements based on observed linguistic patterns. For this study, three different LLMs are utilized. Two of these models are fine-tuned versions of Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERTs), specifically, aeroBERT-NER and aeroBERT-Classifier, which are trained on annotated aerospace corpora. Another LLM, called flair/chunk-english, is utilized to identify sentence chunks present in NL requirements.

As metamodels define complex relationships between domain concepts, it is crucial for a modeler to define these concepts thoroughly while being consistent with respect to the application domain. We propose an approach to assist a modeler in the design of metamodel by recommending relevant domain concepts in several modeling scenarios. Our approach does not require knowledge from the domain or to hand-design completion rules. Instead, we design a fully data-driven approach using a deep learning model that is able to abstract domain concepts by learning from both structural and lexical metamodel properties in a corpus of thousands of independent metamodels. We evaluate our approach on a test set containing 166 metamodels, unseen during the model training, with more than 5000 test samples. Our preliminary results show that the trained model is able to provide accurate top 5 lists of relevant recommendations for concept renaming scenarios. Although promising, the results are less compelling for the scenario of the iterative construction of the metamodel, in part because of the conservative strategy we use to evaluate the recommendations. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

With modelling gaining traction for analysis-heavy use cases like decision-making and regulatory compliance where domain experts play a central role, this barrier is beginning to hurt even more. We posit that Generative AI techniques can significantly lower this barrier by enabling domain experts to construct purposive models by operating at natural language level. This requires domain experts to interact with Generative AI tools using the right purpose-specific contextual prompts. We propose a model-driven approach where purposive meta models guide the interactions between domain expert and Generative AI to generate such prompts. The proposed approach helps in overcoming some of the limitations of Generative AI such as missing local context, limited context window size, attention fading etc. Industry scale models are typically large, necessitating a team of experts to work in a coordinated manner which requires sharing of outputs and persistence across sessions. Our approach brings together MDE and Generative AI in a symbiotic relationship complimenting respective strengths and overcoming limitations. We have validated this approach for development of digital twin based applications and early results are encouraging. © 2023 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

On the other side, development of smart contracts for various blockchain platforms represents a time and effort demanding task due to their special characteristics. In this paper, we explore how ChatGPT can be leveraged for the purpose of automated smart contract generation with aims to reduce the time and effort required for their development. For our case studies, we consider Solidity and DAML smart contract languages. As an outcome, we propose a model-driven framework treating the problem as a dialogue in a specific context between a user on one hand, facilitated via a smart contract model, and a ChatGPT service, on the other hand. According to our results, the approach seems promising, especially due to its flexibility compared to traditional methods. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

The language in which requirements are written is mostly informal and highly individual. This hinders automated processing of requirements as well as the linking of requirements to models. Introducing formal requirement notations in existing projects leads to the challenge of translating masses of requirements and the necessity of training for requirements engineers. In this paper, we derive domain-specific language constructs helping us to avoid ambiguities in requirements and increase the level of formality. The main contribution is the adoption and evaluation of few-shot learning with large pretrained language models for the automated translation of informal requirements to structured languages such as a requirement DSL. © 2022 ACM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

These algorithms cannot directly receive raw models or meta-models as input, but they typically have to be transformed into a numeric representation, i.e., a vector. In this context, a common approach is to use pre-Trained Word Embeddings, which define mapping functions that associate words to semantic vectors. However, current word embeddings are trained with general texts and lack the technical words which typically arise in the modelling domain. To tackle this issue, we have collected a corpus of modelling texts from well-known modelling venues, and we have trained two types of word embedding models. The resulting embeddings (named WordE4MDE) are specialised to address ML tasks in the MDE domain. We have performed an extensive evaluation using the Ecore models of the ModelSet dataset and two state-of-The-Art word embeddings (GloVe and Word2Vec) as baselines. We show that WordE4MDE outperforms these two baselines in three meta-modelling tasks, namely meta-model classification, meta-model clustering, and meta-model concept recommendation. WordE4MDE embeddings are available at https://github.com/models-lab/worde4mde and can be loaded using standard Python libraries for their use in ML pipelines. © 2023 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

The quality of the output depends on crafting a suitable prompt. This has given rise to prompt engineering, the process of designing natural language prompts to best take advantage of the capabilities of generative AI systems.Through experimentation, the creative and research communities have created guidelines and strategies for creating good prompts. However, even for the same task, these best practices vary depending on the particular system receiving the prompt. Moreover, some systems offer additional features using a custom platform-specific syntax, e.g., assigning a degree of relevance to specific concepts within the prompt.In this paper, we propose applying model-driven engineering to support the prompt engineering process. Using a domain-specific language (DSL), we define platform-independent prompts that can later be adapted to provide good quality outputs in a target AI system. The DSL also facilitates managing prompts by providing mechanisms for prompt versioning and prompt chaining. Tool support is available thanks to a Langium-based Visual Studio Code plugin. © 2023 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Many papers are currently devoted to analyzing the potential advantages and limitations of these generative AI models for writing code. However, the analysis of the current state of LLMs with respect to software modeling has received little attention. In this paper, we investigate the current capabilities of ChatGPT to perform modeling tasks and to assist modelers, while also trying to identify its main shortcomings. Our findings show that, in contrast to code generation, the performance of the current version of ChatGPT for software modeling is limited, with various syntactic and semantic deficiencies, lack of consistency in responses and scalability issues. We also outline our views on how we perceive the role that LLMs can play in the software modeling discipline in the short term, and how the modeling community can help to improve the current capabilities of ChatGPT and the coming LLMs for software modeling. © 2023, The Author(s).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

However, these techniques are not yet widespread in the Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) field. In this paper, we explore the use of DL to extract useful text embeddings out of software models. We propose a novel approach to embedding software models by means of transformer architectures trained on large datasets. Our approach combines intermediate representations and Language Models (LMs) to extract features from modelling artefacts in order to enable applications for intelligent model assistance, like model completion and correction. We show that the approach is potentially useful in MDE and may lead to useful results in the future. © 2022 26th Jornadas de Ingenieria del Software y Bases de Datos, JISBD 2022.

On one hand, testing cyber-physical system (CPS) development tools such as MathWorks' Simulink is important as a bug in the toolchain may propagate to the artifacts they produce. On the other hand, it is equally important to understand modeling practices and model evolution to support engineers and scientists as they are widely used in design, simulation, and verification of CPS models. Existing work in this area is limited by two main factors, i.e., (1) inefficiencies of state-of-the-art testing schemes in finding critical tool-chain bugs and (2) the lack of a reusable corpus of public Simulink models. In my thesis, I propose to (1) curate a large reusable corpus of Simulink models to help understand modeling practices and model evolution and (2) leverage such a corpus with deep-learning based language models to test the toolchain. © 2023 Owner/Author.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

These assistants rely on large language models (LLMs), which are foundation models (FMs) that support a wide range of tasks related to understanding and generating language. LLMs have demonstrated their ability to express UML model specifications using formal languages like the Object Constraint Language (OCL). However, the context size of the prompt is limited by the number of tokens an LLM can process. This limitation becomes significant as the size of UML class models increases. In this study, we introduce PathOCL, a novel path-based prompt augmentation technique designed to facilitate OCL generation. PathOCL addresses the limitations of LLMs, specifically their token processing limit and the challenges posed by large UML class models. PathOCL is based on the concept of chunking, which selectively augments the prompts with a subset of UML classes relevant to the English specification. Our findings demonstrate that PathOCL, compared to augmenting the complete UML class model (UML-Augmentation), generates a higher number of valid and correct OCL constraints using the GPT-4 model. Moreover, the average prompt size crafted using PathOCL significantly decreases when scaling the size of the UML class models.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

It deals with the daunting tasks of unifying stakeholders’ perspectives, designers’ intellect, tool-based automation, pattern-driven reuse, and so on, to sketch a blueprint that guides software implementation and evaluation. Despite its benefits, architecture-centric software engineering (ACSE) suffers from a multitude of challenges. ACSE challenges could stem from a lack of standardized processes, socio-technical limitations, and scarcity of human expertise etc. that can impede the development of existing and emergent classes of software. Software Development Bots (DevBots) trained on large language models can help synergise architects’ knowledge with artificially intelligent decision support to enable rapid architecting in a human-bot collaborative ACSE. An emerging solution to enable this collaboration is ChatGPT, a disruptive technology not primarily introduced for software engineering, but is capable of articulating and refining architectural artifacts based on natural language processing. We detail a case study that involves collaboration between a novice software architect and ChatGPT to architect a service-based software. Future research focuses on harnessing empirical evidence about architects’ productivity and explores socio-technical aspects of architecting with ChatGPT to tackle challenges of ACSE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Our research aims to define a novel model-driven reverse engineering (MDRE) approach to extract Unified Modeling Language (UML) and Object Constraint Language (OCL) representations from source code using Large Language Models (LLMs).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Acquiring modelling skills to properly build and use models with the help of modelling formalisms are non-trivial learning objectives, which novice modellers struggle to achieve for several reasons. For example, it is difficult for novice modellers to learn to use their abstraction abilities. Also, due to high student-teacher ratios in a typical classroom setting, novice modellers may not receive personalized and timely feedback on their modelling decisions. These issues hinder the novice modellers in improving their modelling skills. Furthermore, a lack of modelling skills among modellers inhibits the adoption and practice of modelling in industry. Therefore, an automated and intelligent solution is required to help modellers and other practitioners in improving their modelling skills. This doctoral research builds an automated and intelligent solution for one modelling formalism - domain models, in an avatar of a domain modelling bot. The bot automatically extracts domain models from problem descriptions written in natural language and generates intelligent recommendations, particularly for teaching modelling literacy to novice modellers. For this domain modelling bot, we leverage the capabilities of various Artificial Intelligence techniques such as Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Even worse, tools based on large language models like ChatGPT have made it easier than ever to obfuscate plagiarized solutions. Additionally, most plagiarism detectors only apply to code, and only a few approaches exist for modeling assignments, which lack broad resilience to obfuscation attacks. This paper presents a novel approach for automated plagiarism detection in modeling assignments that combines automated analysis with human inspection. We evaluate our approach with real-world assignments and plagiarism obfuscated by ChatGPT. Our results show that we achieve a significantly higher detection rate for AI-generated attacks and a broader resilience than the state-of-the-art.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Our approach exploits the power of large language models by using few-shot prompt learning without the need to train or fine-tune those models with large datasets that are scarce in this field. We implemented our approach and tested it on the completion of static and dynamic domain diagrams. Our initial evaluation shows that such an approach is effective and can be integrated in different ways during the modeling activities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

While deep learning techniques promise to learn such language specifications from sample models, deep learning needs a large number of training data to work well. SLGPT addresses this problem by using transfer learning to leverage the powerful Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2 (GPT-2) model, which has been pre-trained on a large set of training data. SLGPT adapts GPT-2 to Simulink with both randomly generated models and models mined from open-source repositories. SLGPT produced Simulink models that are both more similar to open-source models than its closest competitor, DeepFuzzSL, and found a super-set of the Simulink development toolchain bugs found by DeepFuzzSL.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Typically, software engineers interpret the problem description written in natural language and manually translate it into a domain model. Domain modeling can be time-consuming and highly depends on the expertise of software engineers. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable ability in language understanding, generation, and reasoning. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive, comparative study of using LLMs for fully automated domain modeling. We assess two powerful LLMs, GPT3.5 and GPT4, employing various prompt engineering techniques on a data set containing ten diverse domain modeling examples with reference solutions created by modeling experts. Our findings reveal that while LLMs demonstrate impressive domain understanding capabilities, they are still impractical for full automation, with the top-performing LLM achieving F1 scores of 0.76 for class generation, 0.61 for attribute generation, and 0.34 for relationship generation. Moreover, the F1 score is characterized by higher precision and lower recall; thus, domain elements retrieved by LLMs are often reliable, but there are many missing elements. Furthermore, modeling best practices are rarely followed in auto-generated domain models. Our data set and evaluation provide a valuable baseline for future research in automated LLM-based domain modeling.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
